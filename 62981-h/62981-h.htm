<p>The Twenty-fourth Indiana regiment was one of the first
called for as three years’ volunteers. We were enrolled on the
9th day of July, 1861, to serve for three years, if not sooner
discharged. We were mustered into service July 31st, 1861, at
Camp Knox, which is near Vincennes, Indiana.</p>

<p>Our first camp life after being enrolled was a new mode of
living and sport. Some of the boys had never been very far
from our homes, and were not posted in the pranks and tricks
of the times, even in those early days.</p>

<p>We soon drew a few old Harper’s Ferry muskets. We had a
string guard around the camp. Company drill was held four
hours each day. This was the only amusement which we had
in the daytime, but at night we had magicians, sleight of hand
performers, and others who made amusement for some of us
who had never seen many shows. The tall man and elephant
also paraded through the quarters at night, and this furnished
a great deal of amusement for us.</p>

<p>We got our uniforms August 7th. They were gray and
were about as appropriate as our old Harper’s Ferry muskets.
The guards soon beat the stocks off of the muskets and bent
the ends of the barrels. These they used as canes.</p>

<p>Getting used to camp life was quite a change for some of
us who had been raised up on corn bread, hominy and buttermilk.
There was also a change in the bill of fare. We now had
hard tack, sow belly, and black coffee. There were many other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
changes of life which must be made to make us a happy, united
family.</p>

<p>The weather was very warm at this time, and we soon began
to think that army life was no soft snap.</p>

<p>On the 16th of August we again drew arms. These were
new Harper’s Ferry muskets. Six <ins class="corr" id="tn_16" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Endfield rifles'">
Enfield rifles</ins> were allowed
to each company.</p>

<p>On the next day we marched through the city of Vincennes
on review. All was a hurry and excitement, as the troops were
being sent to the front on that day.</p>

<p>We got marching orders on the 18th, and we got on board a
train bound for East St. Louis, Ill. We arrived there on the
morning of the 19th. We crossed the Mississippi river on the
steamer “Alton City,” marched two and a half miles through
the city of St. Louis, Mo., and went into camp in the Lafayette
Park. Here were the first tents we ever pitched, and all the
boys wanted to learn how.</p>

<p>Lafayette Park is a beautiful park. It contains many fine
animals. There were many of our boys who had never seen
such sights as the city of St. Louis contained. Some of them
had sore eyes on account of so much sight-seeing.</p>

<p>There were many regiments in camp at this park at the same
time we were there.</p>

<p>In a short time we struck tents and marched down the river
a distance of seven miles. We went into camp at Carondelet.
One of the officers named this camp, Camp Allen.</p>

<p>August 27th, Colonel Alvin P. Hovey took command of our
regiment. He soon commenced battalion drill, which was very
hard on us, owing to the warm weather. We had battalion
drill four hours each day and company drill two hours, so you
see that we were somewhat busy.</p>

<p>September 6th, Colonel Hovey, with six of our companies,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
boarded a train on the Iron Mountain railway and made a trip
of twenty-five miles. We left the cars at 8 o’clock p. m. and
made a rapid march of several miles out through a very rough,
broken country. At 5 o’clock in the morning we got orders to
lie down on our arms for a little rest, but not to speak above a
whisper and to be ready to fall in line at a minute’s notice. When
morning came we learned that the rebels had evacuated their
camps and skipped. Thus we were knocked out of a fight at
this place. On account of not having any rebels to shoot at, we
could do nothing else but march <ins class="corr" id="tn_17" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'back aver the'">
back over the</ins> roughest roads
we had ever marched on.</p>

<p>Here was our first experience in foraging off of the country.
But we got a plenty on this trip, such as cream, honey and
peaches&mdash;all of which were good things that we could not get
in camp.</p>

<p>This trip was called the Betty Decker march. I don’t know
why this name was given it unless she was the lady who furnished
us so many good things for our suppers.</p>

<p>We got back to the railroad at 8 p. m., got aboard a train,
and at 10 o’clock arrived at our camp at Carondelet.</p>

<p>While here we had to guard the dry docks while the ironclad
vessels, St. Louis and Carondelet were being built. It was
rumored that these vessels would be blown out of existence before
they were finished, and as half of the people in St. Louis
were ready to do anything for the Southern cause, we believed
it. But nevertheless they were completed and had an active
part in putting down the rebellion.</p>

<p>While we were drilling and guarding at this place we could
see other regiments at Benton Barracks who were strengthening
their fortifications. Now was the time when something had to
be done to invade Missouri.</p>

</div>


<p>September 16th, 1861, we got marching orders, struck tents,
and boarded a steamboat which carried us to St. Louis. We left
the boat and while marching up Main street on our way to the
Union station was the first charge which the old Twenty-fourth
struck. Drums and fifes were playing when four large gray
horses drawing a big delivery wagon collided with the head of
our column, knocking it east and west. Several of our boys
were slightly bruised, but they were more frightened than injured.
In this way James R. Dalton and John W. Hostetter
got their discharges.</p>

<p>That night we boarded a train, pulled by two engines, of
twenty flat cars, fifty men to a car. We started westward to
open up the Union Pacific railroad over which a train had not
run for months. The weeds had grown upon the track until
the engines could hardly pull their own weight. We traveled
very slowly, and the morning of the 17th found us not many
miles from St. Louis.</p>

<p>Half of our train had been cut loose and the engines had
pulled on to the next switch. They soon returned for the balance
of the train. At this place we heard the first national
songs which we had heard sung in rebeldom. Some ladies carrying
the grand old Stars and Stripes came out on the portico
and sang “The Star Spangled Banner,” “The Red, White and
Blue,” and other national songs. You bet there were cheers
which went up for those union ladies.</p>

<p>This was the first time that Colonel Hovey knew that In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>diana
soldiers would eat chickens. But he found it out now, as
the boys came straggling to the cars, at the call of the whistle,
loaded with chickens and peaches. Colonel Hovey called, “Take
them back, you d&mdash;&mdash; chicken thieves, or I’ll have you arrested.
I didn’t think I had started out with a clan of Indiana thieves.”</p>

<p>Some of the boys became angry and made threats, while
others laughed and were jolly about it. But it was all soon forgotten
as the train pulled out. We had to walk by the side of
the engine and throw gravel under the drive-wheels so that the
engine would pull anything.</p>

<p>We went through three tunnels and came to Jefferson City.
This is the capital of Missouri. Governor Jackson had the
State House burned and skipped out with the old rebel, General
Price.</p>

<p>At 11 o’clock p. m., September 7th, two engines, coupled
together, and pulling our full train, went on west. Just as we
started one of the boys of Company D fell under the car and
was instantly killed.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 18th the engines could not pull their
own weights and each company cut loose and pushed their own
cars. While doing this, Brown of Company B, fell under the
car and the wheels ran over his leg.</p>

<p>We pushed up the grades and rode down them. Sometimes
we even had to push the engines.</p>

<p>We reached Syracuse late on the evening of the 18th. We
got off of the cars, marched out and went into camp near the
town. A strong picket line was posted and a strict order was
placed on the pickets. A heavy penalty of death was imposed
on those who slept on their post.</p>

<p>The moon shined bright and at 10 o’clock the still night air
was disturbed by the tramp of horses’ feet and rattle of sabers
coming towards our camp. The picket who was posted on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
road did not wait to challenge the supposed enemy, but fired his
gun and skedaddled to camp. The pickets all around the camp
fired their guns and ran.</p>

<p>The long roll was beat and all was hustle and bustle in camp.
“Fall in, fall in!” was the order from colonel and captains, “and
get ready for action.” In four minutes the old Twenty-fourth
was ready for action and facing the supposed enemy. Several
were shaking as with the ague, yet they were ready to take their
medicine.</p>

<p>In a few minutes we saw a single orderly coming down the
road. He rode up and asked, “What the h&mdash;&mdash; does this mean?”
Colonel Hovey, standing there in his night clothes, with his
fighting blood up, answered him pretty roughly and wanted to
know who it was. We found out that it was Colonel Eads’
home guards of “Jayhawkers” who had come from California
to join our army. We then broke ranks and went back to our
quarters to dream of the false alarm and the excitement <ins class="corr" id="tn_20" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'which Colenel'">
which Colonel</ins> Eads’ Jayhawkers caused us.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 20th we struck tents and marched
seven miles west. Here, at the Lamine river, we went into
camp. THIS camp was called Camp Morton.</p>

<p>The next morning heavy details were sent out to build fortifications
for picket duty and to guard the Lamine bridge while
the carpenters rebuilt it. This bridge had been burned by the
rebels a few days before we got there.</p>

<p>The Twenty-fourth Indiana was the first regiment to arrive
at this place, but there were more brigades on the way to reinforce
us, some by way of the Missouri river and some by rail,
as we had come.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 23d we were joined by the Second
Indiana Cavalry. We now had the bridge completed, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
trains ran over it and went as far as Sedalia, this being as far
as the road was completed at that time.</p>

<p>At about this time, the Eighteenth and Twenty-sixth Indiana
landed on the banks of the Missouri river, and it being a very
dark night, they ran into the Twenty-second Indiana. They had
quite a little spat before they found out their mistake. The Major
and six men of the Twenty-second were killed.</p>

<p>On the 30th of September we marched to Georgetown, the
county seat of Pettice county. It was dark when we reached
the town. As we found no enemy to oppose us we went into
quarters in the court house.</p>

<p>Here the Eighth, Eighteenth, Twenty-second, Twenty-fifth,
Twenty-sixth Indiana regiments and the Eighth Missouri and
ten pieces of artillery joined us. We were collecting an army
to raise the siege of Lexington, which was twenty miles above
here. Rebel General Price had had Colonel Muligan, with a
handful of our soldiers, cooped up there for several days. General
Fremont was getting his troops together to raise the siege,
but he was too slow. The little garrison of 2,800 Union men
defended the fort five days against a superior force of 11,000
men.</p>

<p>An order was given to mount the Twenty-fourth Indiana on
mules. We marched <ins class="corr" id="tn_21" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'to the carrall'">
to the corral</ins> and tried to break several of
those wild bucking mules. The order was countermanded. That
evening we started on the march, but had only gone a few miles
when we met our paroled prisoners. They reported that they
held out five days and then ran out of rations and ammunition.
They also stated that their loss was 60 killed and 40 wounded.
The rebel loss was unknown.</p>

<p>We about faced and went back to camp. On the 5th of
October we moved out on an open field and pitched tents. Here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
we drew two months’ pay. This was the first time that we had
ever drawn any of Uncle Sam’s money. The officers were paid
with gold coin.</p>

<p>While at this place we drilled six hours each day. We received
marching orders on the tenth of the month, but the
order was countermanded. On the morning of the 16th we
again received marching orders. We struck tents and marched
a distance of two miles to Sedalia, a town at the end of the
Pacific railroad.</p>

<p>The war had stopped all the progress of the railroad. The
workmen had stacked their shovels, picks, and wheelbarrows in
a large cut and had fled in all directions.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>


<p>We boarded a train and went to Tipton, which was twenty
miles distant. Here, on the 19th, we drew uniforms.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 21st we received marching orders,
struck tents, packed our knapsacks and marched in the direction
of Springfield, which is south of this place. At the end of
a fifteen-mile march we halted and went into camp. On the
morning of the 2d we continued our march. At 4 o’clock we
came to a halt and went into camp in a little black-oak grove.
Our feet were blistered from marching over the rough mountain
roads, and many of the boys fell out of the ranks and straggled
in late at night.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 24th we took up our line of march.
After a hard day of travel we came to the little town of Warsaw.
We crossed the Osage river and went into camp.</p>

<p>While here General Fremont received the news from one of
his spies that General Price’s army was at Springfield. We
were called into line early the next morning. We moved out
seven miles and the order was then countermanded. Therefore
we went into camp in a field which was covered with burrs.
For this reason we named this place Camp Burr.</p>

<p>Our boys were about played out on account of heavy marching,
and so each of our companies bought an ox team to haul
our baggage. Our quartermaster sent our train back to Tipton
after supplies of ammunition and rations. This was supposed
to be our base of supplies.</p>

<p>On the evening of November 1st, 1861, we received orders<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
to leave our tents, and in light marching order move out and
march in the direction of Springfield. At 8 p. m. we moved out
eight miles through the dark night and came to our main army
to consolidate our regiment with our division, brigades, etc.,
which were commanded by Generals Pope, Hunter, and Jeff C.
Davis.</p>

<p>The next morning we marched through a little town by the
name of Black Oak Point, and after a hard day’s march we
went into camp in a meadow. We were all very tired and foot-sore.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 3d we marched through the little
town of Buffalo, crossed Greasy Creek, and went into camp.</p>

<p>We were all worn out with the day’s journey. Most of us
had eaten a cold lunch and had lain down for a little rest. A
few of the boys were cooking beef and trying to prepare some
food for the morrow when the bugle sounded the assembly to
fall in line and march. We slung knapsacks, fell in line, and
marched off in double quick time. Some of the boys were
swearing because they had to throw their beef, which had just
started to boil, out of the kettles.</p>

<p>We felt sure that we would have a chance to take old General
Price in that night. Everyone was worn out and angry,
and their fighting blood was at its highest pitch. We marched
all night, and early in the morning we waded Pometytor creek.
We then halted for a short rest. We had nothing for breakfast
except a few pieces of hard tack to munch on.</p>

<p>This was the 4th day of November. After a short rest we
fell in line, marched off as fast as our swollen feet would allow
us to. At 4 o’clock we reached Springfield. After a forced
march of fifty miles, without sleep and with very little to eat,
we were in splendid fighting order&mdash;mad and worn out.</p>

<p>But our chance for a battle had slipped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>As old Price’s army had skipped, all mounted on gray horses,
General Fremont with his one hundred bodyguards, started in
pursuit. They ran into Price’s rear guard. I heard some shots
fired, and it was reported that a few shots were exchanged
with the rear guard of General Price’s retreating army.</p>

<p>Here we forced a junction with General Lane’s army, which
swelled the number of our forces to about 35,000. General
Lane had several Indians under his command&mdash;some 1,200
Cherokees. It was reported that he sent them after the rebel
forces which were retreating towards Cassville, which is in Barry
county. I never heard of those Indians afterwards. They must
have been disbanded.</p>

<p>We went into camp that night about a mile from town. On
the morning of the 5th of November, Colonel Hovey took command
of a brigade.</p>

<p>On the night of the 6th, cheering was heard throughout our
army, as some grapevine or false dispatches had reached our
officers of a great victory gained in the east. The thunder of
drums and voices were heard for miles.</p>

<p>General Fremont received instructions not to follow Price
farther into the mountains, or he would be caught in a trap. On
the morning of the 9th we received orders to march back to
Tipton.</p>

<p>On the 13th our regiment and the Forty-second Illinois
marched on a race to Camp Burr. We beat them by five hours.
On the morning of the 14th we made double quick time back to
Osage Bridge, in order that we might get there before General
Sturges’ brigade arrived there. We crossed the river and went
into camp. We stayed two days waiting for our supply train.</p>

<p>We went to Tipton on the 20th of November. This completed
the Springfield march.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>While on this expedition General Fremont issued a proclamation
to free all the slaves who made their way into our lines.
Soon they were flocking in by the score. For assuming this
authority General Fremont was superceded by General Pope.
His name was never mentioned again in the history of our late
civil war, as he was placed on the retired list of our good old
generals who had served their time faithfully in our past wars.</p>

<p>We pitched tents at Tipton and went into camp for a few
days rest. The weather was getting somewhat cold, making
our camp life somewhat disagreeable. We stayed here until the
morning of the 27th, when we struck tents and marched to
Syracuse. Here we went into camp and stayed until the morning
of the 29th, at which time we got orders to march back to
Tipton again. We were getting tired of running around so
much, and having no fighting to do, as we had been promised
that we would put down the rebellion in thirty days. As yet we
had not even made a start. Some of our boys were getting
homesick and wanted to fight it out in a pitched battle. Some of
them thought that they could clean up five little greased rebels.</p>

<p>We went into camp two miles north of Tipton, in a little
grove. On the night of December 1st five inches of snow fell,
we then had a grand time hunting rabbits. We remained here
until the 6th, when we drew two months’ pay.</p>

<p>We broke camp the next day and marched to the Lamine
bridge. A heavy rain fell that night, overflowing our camp
and making it a disagreeable place. We lay here until the
morning of the 15th, when we got marching orders to move
over to Sedalia. We went into camp a little north of town.
While here we received the report that our advance under Pope
had captured 1,540 prisoners, without firing a shot.</p>

<p>While here we formed a scouting party detailed out of the
Twenty-fourth Indiana. Concealed in covered wagons we
traveled all night. In the morning we came to an open prairie.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
From here we sent part of the detail to a large mill and distillery.
A few shots were exchanged between the guards and our
boys. In a short time the guards mounted their horses and rode
as if for their lives. There were about twenty men on guard.
They had a number of bushels of corn, several pounds of bacon,
and some barrels of old copper distilled whiskey. The boys
loaded one of our wagons with the beverage and set fire to the
building. We then started back to Sedalia, as we had accomplished
what we were sent to do. On our way back the wagon
loaded with whiskey broke down and we had to leave it. Out
of all of that whiskey we only got a small drink of whiskey
each. We reached camp and reported our success. As soon as
it was dark Lieutenant Sheeks, with a small detail, started after
the wagon which we had left.</p>

<p>Colonel Eads had run across the wagon and went into camp
at this place. They were having a time drinking the good old
liquor which the wagon contained. The night was very dark,
and when Lieutenant Sheeks reached the top of the hill he
heard quite a number of men around the wagon. Thinking that
they were rebels, he ordered the boys to fire into them. Colonel
Eads’ men also thought that we were rebels, and returned the
fire. After several shots were exchanged, Lieutenant Sheeks
withdrew, as we were outnumbered five to one. We never learned
of our mistake until the next evening. No one was seriously
injured, as all the shots flew wide of their mark on account of
the darkness. This battle was named “Sheeks’ Defeat.”</p>

<p>While here a five-inch snow fell, making a very disagreeable
time. On the night of the 23d of December we got orders to
march back to our old camp at Lamine Bridge. This was one
of the coldest, hardest marches of our service. While on the
journey a sleet fell and froze. The batteries all had to be left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
at the foot of the hills, as the horses could not pull them up the
hill on account of it being so slippery.</p>

<p>When we reached camp we were almost frozen and there was
no wood to make fires with. We had built log cabins here for
winter quarters, but there was no chance to get fire only to tear
down our cabins. We did this and piled the logs in heaps. We
set fire to these. We made coffee and soon became warm and
comfortable.</p>

<p>We soon began preparations for sleeping. We spread tents
on the snow and sixteen to a bed we lay down and pulled our
blankets over us. A snow fell, which covered us over and kept
us warm. When the reveille sounded at four o’clock the next
morning it was a sight to see the boys crawling out from under
their snow beds to answer roll call.</p>

<p>A heavy detail from the Twenty-fourth Indiana was sent
to pull the batteries up the hill. The horses and mules had
failed but the old Twenty-fourth was reliable.</p>

<p>The 24th of December found us with tents once more, with
tents pitched at the Lamine Bridge. On Christmas Day some of
the boys got drunk on stomach bitters and had a jolly time.</p>

<p>January 1st, 1862, we had a general inspection. Our work
at this place was hard, as we now built Fort Lamine. The snow
lay on the ground six inches deep, and the ground was frozen
to a depth of eighteen inches. This made it slow work building
fortifications. Some days each man could not pick out a yard
of the frozen dirt.</p>

<p>While at this work several of the boys froze their hands and
feet and some of them had to have their fingers and toes amputated.
These received discharges.</p>

<p>January 18th a detail of twenty men was called out to go
with a foraging train after hay and corn. We went ten miles
northwest. Here we found plenty of hay and corn. We camped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
in negro quarters. We killed a hog and had the negro cooks to
get our supper and breakfast.</p>

<p>We loaded our train and gave the old farmer a due bill on
Uncle Sam and started to camp with lots of good things, such
as apples, honey and potatoes, hidden in the hay. The weather
continued to turn colder, and we almost froze on our return to
camp.</p>

<p>On the 12th another train composed of ox teams, was sent
after corn and hay. Several of the guards of this train were
badly frozen.</p>

<p>On the 15th we drew Sibly tents and stoves, but it wasn’t
before we needed them. On the 27th we drew pay for two
months. We also drew plenty of rations. We had bacon to
spare. There was no wood to burn in our little sheet iron
stoves and so we kept them red hot with bacon.</p>

<p>The citizens brought cakes, pies, apples, and cider into camp
and sold them cheap. The boys ran some of them out and called
them rebels, but we had not yet seen a real rebel.</p>

<p>At about this date we had one soldier in Company I who
did not fill inspection. For this a detail carried him to the
Lamine river, cut the ice and stripped and washed him all over.
He was afterwards one of our best lieutenants.</p>

<p>After February 1st, 1862, our camp duty was lighter. A
string guard which was composed of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth
Illinois, Twenty-fourth and Twenty-sixth Indiana, and
Fryberger’s battery of six twelve-pound guns, was placed around
the brigade at this fort.</p>

<p>Friday, February 7th, 1862, we received marching orders,
struck tents, and marched as far as Syracuse. On the 8th we
marched through Tipton and on the evening of the 10th we
went into camp near Jefferson City. We stayed in this camp
until the 13th, when we went to town. Here a part of the
regiment had quarters in the State House and the rest were in
a large church house.</p>

<p>The weather at this date was below zero and there was
plenty of snow on the ground. We had marched about eighty
miles, over a very rough road and were worn out. Some of the
boys almost played out on the morning of the 15th.</p>

<p>Stowed away in box cars, with fifty men to a car, we started
for St. Louis. Early in the morning our train stopped at a
small station for fuel and water. We were just in front of a
little saloon, and as the boys were almost frozen, some were allowed
to get out and get them a dram. Frank Smith, of our
company, brought back a five-gallon keg of peach brandy and
rolled it in through the car door. The door was closed as soon
as all could get in. Some kind of a hammer was procured and
the head of the keg was knocked in. The boys soon had their
cups filled with brandy instead of coffee. The train started and
the boys soon had the brandy keg emptied.</p>

<p>There was no more complaining of the cold, but it was certainly
a mixed up drunken mess. Some of the boys wanted to
fight but it did not amount to much because we were too thick
and crowded to fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>We got to the Union depot at St. Louis at 7 p. m. and at 8
o’clock we marched on board the steamer Iatan. On the morning
of the 16th we ran into blocked ice at Cairo, Ill., the place
where the Ohio runs into the Mississippi. We had to hammer
away about four hours in order that we might get through the
ice.</p>

<p>We passed Cairo, turned up the Ohio river, and landed at
Paducah, Kentucky.</p>

<p>Here, on February 17th, we heard of the surrender of Fort
Donellson. Several boats were lying at this place filled with the
wounded. We went on up the river to Smithland, and here we
turned our boat up the Cumberland river.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" id="tn_32" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'On the moning'">
On the morning</ins> of the 18th of February, 1862, we landed at
the Bluffs, under the big guns of Fort Donellson, Tennessee.
We marched out through the dead bodies of both armies which
had not yet been buried, for our troops were almost played out
after three days of hard fighting.</p>

<p>During the battle, General Pillow and Johnson cut their
way through our lines and made their escape to Nashville with
a brigade. Our final charge was made on the 17th, at which
time the garrison surrendered with 5,000 prisoners and a number
of heavy guns which were mounted on the fort. Our loss
at this place was heavy, about 1,500 in killed, wounded and
prisoners. The rebel loss was about 1,800.</p>

<p>We went into camp on a small island opposite Donellson.
At 10 o’clock that night the river rose and overflowed our camp.
There was some hustling around to get our tents and camp
equipage moved. We then pitched tents on the other side of
the river.</p>

<p>On the 23d a squad of twenty men was detailed to go up
the river on a scouting expedition. We went as far as Bell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>wood
Furnace, which was nine miles from Donellson. We saw
a few rebels at a distance, fired a few shots at them and fell back.
On our return to camp we killed several squirrels for our sick
in the hospital. The squirrels were plentiful and gentle at this
place.</p>

<p>We remained at this camp until March 6th, when we received
marching orders. We struck tents, got on a boat, and
crossed the river. While landing at this place Adjutant Barter
lost his horse. It fell through the staging and broke its leg.</p>

<p>We marched in the direction of Fort Henry until 5 o’clock
in the evening, when we went into camp for the night. The land
was rolling and timbered with pine at this place.</p>

<p>On the 7th we marched to Fort Henry on the Tennessee
river. We went into camp near the fort. This place had been
taken by our forces about three weeks before. It was well fortified
and was mounted with sixty heavy guns. It showed the
marks of a hard-fought battle.</p>

<p>We lay here until the 9th. We then marched down to the
landing, and got on board the steamboat, “Telegraph No. 3,”
and ran up the river as far as High Piney Bluffs. Here we
lashed on to another boat, which had on board the Eleventh Indiana
and Eighth Missouri regiments. The two boats pulled
on up the river one hundred miles and on the evening of the
12th of March, 1862, we landed at a little town called Savannah.</p>

<p>We marched off of the boats and formed our brigade in
hollow square. Washington’s Farewell Address was read to us
by A. J. Smith, who was to be the commander of our brigade.
It was composed of the Eleventh, Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth
Indiana and the Eighth Missouri. General Lew Wallace
commanded the Twelfth Division.</p>

<p>We moved back on to the boats and at 10 o’clock that night
we ran on up the river seven miles to Crump’s Landing. Here a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
shot was fired by one of our gunboats as a signal for us to land.
Our boat ran into the shore with such force that it knocked
almost everyone down. But we were soon on our feet again.
As soon as the staging reached the shore we got to land as fast
as we could run off of the boat.</p>

<p>This was a night long to be remembered. The rain was
pouring down, and it was so dark that we could not see where
we were going, only by the frequent flashes of lightning.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">The thunder rolled from pole to pole,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We moved out five miles, found no enemy. We then halted
for a short rest, as the mud was very bad and the water was
sometimes knee deep. When daylight appeared, some were
leaning against trees, some were on brush-piles and others were
even laying down in the mud and water, and all were sound
asleep.</p>

<p>Our cavalry passed us here. They went on as far as Perdy,
found no enemy, and returned in the evening. We all marched
back to the boats on the night of the 14th.</p>

<p>Our regiment was called out on picket duty. A battery was
planted on the road, making a strong guard. We knew that
there was a large force of rebels somewhere near us. At daylight
we were relieved by the Eighth Missouri, and went back
to the boat. The rain had poured down all night and we were
in somewhat of a soaked condition.</p>

<p>Tuesday, the 18th, our division of 9,000 men moved off of
the boats and marched out into the timber half a mile. Here
all of the divisions went into camp. Grant, whose headquarters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
were at Savannah, had 35,000 more troops at Pittsburgh Landing
nine miles above here.</p>

<p>We still continued our brigade drill. April 1st, 1862, our
brigade was on review. We could hear the boom of the cannon
in the direction of Corinth. On that day Colonel Hovey made
us a little talk.</p>

<p>He said, “I think that the battle has commenced on our left
wing. But I wish that we could see the whites of the rebels’
eyes. Now, Twenty-fourth, all of you have mothers, sisters and
sweethearts back in Indiana homes and I hope and trust that you
will never let the disgraceful name of a coward go back to those
dear ones who are praying each day for your honor and life to
be spared.” When his speech was ended three cheers went up
for Colonel A. P. Hovey.</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock in the evening of the 5th our bugle sounded
the assembly for us to fall in line. The rain was falling as fast
as I ever saw rain fall, but it was all the same, we had to march
to&mdash;no one knew where. The water was from shoe-top deep
to knee deep, all over the road. <ins class="corr" id="tn_35" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Still we splunged'">
Still we plunged</ins> on. It was
so dark that we could not see where to go and we had to keep
touch with the file men.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Gurber’s horse fell into a hole but got out
again. Captain Erwin measured his length in a ditch that was
five feet deep. There was plenty of swearing and grumbling
going on that night. We marched as far as Adamsville, found
no enemy, and returned to camp at 7 o’clock April 6th, 1862.</p>

<p>The roar of cannon and rattle of musketry could plainly be
heard. The battle of Shiloh had now commenced in earnest.
At nine o’clock General Grant, on his way from Savannah to
Shiloh, landed and gave us orders to get to the battlefield as
quickly as possible. We were called into line in light marching
orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>Colonel Hovey spoke a few encouraging words to the boys,
impressing upon their minds friends and honor. He told us
what we were about to go into. He also said that he wanted
us to go in like soldiers and men.</p>

<p>We started off on quick time, our regiment in the advance.
The roar of the battle became plainer every minute. About 11
a. m. our advance guard came dashing back and reported us to
be exactly in the rear of Bragg’s army and only a few miles
distant. We got orders to about face. We double quicked three
miles back and went the river road. This road curves with the
river and this made the march much longer. We could hear
the noise from that desperate struggle and carnage all evening.</p>

<p>Late in the day we passed squad after squad of our soldiers
coming from the battlefield, whipped. We came up within a
mile of the battle ground. Here we passed one soldier laying
on his face and scared to death. Some of the officers said,
“Turn him over and see if he is dead.” He then spoke and
said, “Boys, you had better go back. We are all killed or captured.
There ain’t enough of us left for a string guard.” When
we slipped in between the lines a short time later we found that
he had come near telling the truth. But we found a few brave
fellows huddled down at the landing, who were not yet whipped,
but Sherman’s battery and the gunboats were all that saved the
little band of heroes. They also saved the day.</p>

<p>General Prentice was surprised on the morning of the 6th.
Most of his brigade were taken as prisoners, and the General
himself captured as a prisoner, and it was seven months before
he was exchanged.</p>

<p>Sidney Johnson had been killed in the evening and this had
put a damper over the rebel army.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" id="tn_36" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Bureguard had been'">
Beauregard had been</ins> too sure of a victory. He made his
brags that he could let his troops rest during the night, and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
the morning ride down to the river to water his horse and find
the yanks all sticking up white rags. But he missed his mark.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" id="tn_37" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Buregard and Johnson'">
Beauregard and Johnson</ins> had 60,000 men and they had pounced
upon a force of 35,000, many of whom had never been in such
a fight. There were not more than 7,000 in the ranks of the
Union forces at the closing charge on the evening of the first
day’s fight at Shiloh.</p>

<p>Between sundown and dark our division, under Wallace,
slipped in between the lines of the rebel and union forces, <ins class="corr" id="tn_38" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'while our bunboats'">
while our gunboats</ins> constantly threw shells over into the rebel ranks.
All during the night, under this same protection, Nelson’s forces
were being brought across the river, and General Buell’s army
was coming up the river from Savannah, as reinforcements.
These two forces numbered 35,000.</p>

<p>The union force outnumbered that of the confederates then
by 17,000.</p>

<p>That night the rebels drew their lines back about one and a
half miles. Our division laid down in line of battle and remained
in that position all night, with the rain pouring down
all the time. The groans of the dying and wounded were terrible
to hear, yet many of us slept soundly until we were awakened to
fall in line.</p>

<p>At 4 o’clock on the morning of the 7th, drenched in rain and
very hungry, Wallace’s division plunged into the fight on the
right of the army of <ins class="corr" id="tn_38a" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'the Tennessee anl'">
the Tennessee and</ins> opened the battle of the
second day’s fight.</p>

<p>We moved out one mile and formed our line of battle. Our
brigade supported the Ninth Indiana battery. We were charged
by a regiment of rebel cavalry. They were repulsed in a short
time and went back faster than they came.</p>

<p>Companies A and B were placed on the skirmish line with
Birds’ sharpshooters. We charged on two big twelve-pound batteries
which were raining shot and shell into our lines, causing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
great destruction. We got within forty yards of their guns and
silenced them for a few minutes, but they then double shotted
with canister and drove us back. We soon met our main column
coming up into the charge.</p>

<p>Our two companies got lost from our regiment and fell in
line with a Kentucky regiment. We supported the center of
our army, while it was driving the enemy back on the flanks in
every charge. The center which we supported was masked with
three firing lines. The fighting was awful.</p>

<p>The batteries were pushed up by hand and as many as two
files of wounded were going back to the rear for an hour. The
earth shook as if with an earthquake. It seemed as if nothing
could live in the hell of fire. One could taste the sulphur and
the shell and bullets could have been stirred with a stick. The
atmosphere was blue with lead.</p>

<p>The rebels were drawing off on the flanks and were holding
their center with all their strength to cover their retreat. At 3
p. m. General Bragg, seeing that he had come to stay, withdrew
his army and skedaddled in the direction of Corinth. He
was whipped and had left 8,000 men on the field dead and dying.
Among them was Sidney Johnson, one of the South’s best generals.</p>

<p>Our cavalry followed up the retreat a few miles, picked up a
few prisoners and was called back.</p>

<p>The union loss at this place was 10,000. The loss in the
Twenty-fourth Indiana was thirty-two killed and wounded. We
lost three officers who were as good and brave as any who ever
drew saber. Lieutenant Colonel Gruber was struck in the breast
with a spent cannon ball while in front of the regiment on the
charge. Lieutenant Southwick of Company B, had his jaw shot
off with grape shot. Captain McGuffin, of Company I, was shot
through the breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>A report From History of the Battle of Shiloh.</p>

<p>Grant, with his victorious army, moved up the Tennessee
river to Shiloh. Here, April the 6th, 1862, he was attacked by
General A. S. Johnson and driven back.</p>

<p>The night after the battle General Buell brought a large
force of Union troops. The Union troops outnumbered the Confederates
now by seventeen thousand. The next day Grant
gained his second <ins class="corr" id="tn_40" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'great victroy'">
great victory</ins>.</p>

<p>He said in his report, “I am indebted to General Sherman
for the success of the battle.”</p>

<p>Twenty-five thousand men, dead and wounded, lay on the
field after the battle.</p>

<p>When the battle was over we lay down on the battlefield and
remained there all night without anything to eat. A steady rain
was falling and had been for several days. The 8th and 9th the
wounded were cared for and the dead buried. This put an end
to the bloody battle of Shiloh.</p>

<p>We lay here on the field five days without shelter or rations,
except what the other regiments, stationed here gave to us. On
the 13th a detail was sent after our tents and camp equipage. It
was still raining, but we had to move out and do something, as
we could already hear the “graybacks” crawling in the leaves.</p>

<p>On the 16th we moved out to the front and went into a
camp in a nice meadow. Here we had four hours’ brigade drill
each day.</p>

<p>General Halleck soon took charge of this army and commenced
to advance on Corinth, where Bragg had a force of
60,000 troops, well fortified. On the 20th a small squad of rebel
cavalry ran into our picket line. Our lines were reinforced and
we had to stand in line of battle from 4 o’clock until daylight.</p>

<p>Our fatigue guard duty was now heavy. Almost all of our
time was employed. The weather was getting fine. Leaves
were putting forth and the aroma of the flowers filled the air.

say, “How foolish for human butchers to slaughter one another.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>On the 26th we marched to a place called Hamburgh, seven
miles away. We found no enemy and returned to camp on the
27th of April.</p>

<p>May 2d, 1862, we marched out near Perdy, a distance of
about ten miles. We halted, went into camp, and sent a force
of cavalry on to burn the railroad bridge. The cavalry returned
at 4 o’clock in the evening of the 3d and reported that there was
a heavy guard at the bridge, and they had not fired a shot at the
enemy. General Wallace sent them back with orders to burn
that bridge at all hazards, or he would dismount them and send
the infantry on their mounts. That trip they burned the bridge,
captured some prisoners, and ran the train into the bridge.</p>

<p>We could hear the distant boom of our gunboats and heavy
artillery that were advancing on Corinth. We started back to
camp. It had rained and we had a very muddy, hard march on
the return.</p>

<p>On May 8th we took up our line of march to the front. We
moved out in the direction of Corinth, Mississippi, and went into
camp on Gravel Ridge.</p>

<p>Our division was held in reserve four miles in the rear of
our main army. We had an army of 80,000 collected here. The
Union force was trying to dig a canal to get the gunboats near
enough for action. We had Corinth almost surrounded and the
heavy guns kept up a constant bombardment.</p>

<p>We had battalion drill two hours each day. We were drilled
by Spicely, who was major at that time. About this time we
drew four months’ pay, which amounted to fifty-two dollars.</p>

<p>Our picket duty was extremely heavy, as the rebel cavalry
made frequent visits to our lines. There was heavy skirmishing
in the advance at all times. We were closing in too near to suit
old <ins class="corr" id="tn_42" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Bureguard and Bragg'">
Beauregard and Bragg</ins>.</p>

<p>On the 26th of May Bragg’s army to a man evacuated Cor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>inth.
It was no siege&mdash;merely a draw battle. That army went
in the direction of Richmond. Most of them went by railroad.
This was the end of the first battle of Corinth.</p>

<p>June 2d we received marching orders, and on the morning
of the 3d we marched in the direction of Memphis, Tennessee.
The roads were dry and dusty, making our march very disagreeable.
We passed through Union Town on the 8th. Here was
the first place on this march where we had seen the Stars and
Stripes waved by citizens, and you bet the boys gave them three
cheers and a tiger.</p>

<p>We marched on through Bolivar and on the night of the 13th
we went into camp near Memphis. After a march of a hundred
miles, we were all tired and ready for a little rest, but our rest
was yet to come, for at 1 a. m. o’clock the next morning the
bugle sounded the assembly. We fell in line and marched to
the city.</p>

<p class="noindent">but on our weary boys tramped into Memphis. We took refuge
under sheds, porches or any place else to get shelter from the
rain. The next morning we marched down to the river bank,
pitched tents and went into camp.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 16th we were ordered out seven miles
back of the town on a scout. We found no enemy and marched
back to camp. We had a heavy provost guard at this place to
keep the boys from running around over town.</p>

<p>We received marching orders on the morning of the 17th.
We embarked on a steamer, and went as far as Helena, Arkansas.
Here we got orders to reinforce General Curtis who was in
Missouri with a small force, at that time. We got on board a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
boat and ran down the river, sixty miles below Helena. Here
we turned our course up White River as far as Aberdeen, a small
town on the bank of the river.</p>

<p>We could not hear of the whereabouts of Curtis’ army, and
on the 4th of July, we remained all day at Crockett’s Bluff. On
the 6th, six companies of our regiment under command of
Colonel W. T. Spicely, marched out about six miles to Grand
Prairie. Here we ran into a force of the 2nd Texas cavalry,
about four hundred in number. Only four of our companies
were in line. These companies numbered about 180. The
rebels charged up within thirty steps of us. They lay over on
the opposite sides of their horses and fired at us with double
barrel shotguns, from under their horses’ necks.</p>

<p>They were repulsed, tried the second charge, and were driven
off in disorder.</p>

<p>Colonel Fitch’s command was two miles in our rear but they
did not get up in time for the fight. Late in the evening we
returned to the boats and Colonel Fitch treated us to the beer.
On the morning of the 7th all the troops marched to Grand
Prairie again. There was some skirmishing with the rebel
pickets but they made no stand. We had battalion drill at 10
o’clock that night.</p>

</div>


<p>July 7th, we marched as far as Clarenden, a distance of ten
miles. We crossed the river and went into camp in the town.
We remained here until the evening of the 9th. We got a dispatch
that Curtis’ army had made its way through to Helena.</p>

<p>We embarked on boats and at night ran back down the river.
Our boat ran on to a snag and almost sank, but we got it off and
repaired after quite a lot of work. On the 14th we landed at
Helena again. We found General Curtis’ command here. They
had had a hard time marching from Missouri down through
Arkansas.</p>

<p>We stayed here drilling and doing camp duty until August
9th. We then marched to Clarenden on White River, sixty
miles distant, but found no enemy. The weather was hot and
the roads dusty, making a fearful march. But nevertheless, we
found plenty to eat on the way, such as pork, chicken, honey and
other good things. On the 19th we got back to Helena, covered
with sweat and dust. We looked more like the black brigade
than white folks.</p>

<p>August 27th, we got on board a boat and went thirty miles
up the St. Francis river, on a scout. We landed the boat, got
off, and marched through the canebrake seven miles. We found
no enemy and returned to our boat the “Hamilton Belle.” When
we got on board we found her loaded to the guard with cattle,
cotton, sugar, pork, and all kinds of forage picked up by the boys.</p>

<p>We started back to Helena, and landed a short distance from
our camp at 2 o’clock in the morning of the 28th. We had quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
a time getting our private forage ashore as the general, E. O. C.
Ord, put a guard at the staging and would not let the boys take
anything with them off of the boat. What they didn’t get off
they rolled into the river.</p>

<p>September 4th, 1862, several companies of our regiment went
on a scout up the river after Bushwhackers. We went up to
Chalk Bluffs, below Memphis. We found no enemy and started
back to Helena. We had not gone far when a volley was fired
into us by a force of mounted rebels. Our boat in command of
Lieutenant Colonel Barter, landed. He ordered us off and out
after them. After a run of three miles we decided that we could
not run down mounted rebels and make them fight.</p>

<p>We marched back to the boat and continued our return to
Helena. We landed there the evening of the 6th.</p>

<p>On the 16th, a detail got on a boat and went thirty miles up
the river, after a load of wood. On the 23rd, we had a sham
battle. We had quite a time at this and we then settled down
to camp life. We had brigade drill four hours each day from
then until October 16th when we got orders to go up White
River.</p>

<p>We embarked on boats and went down to the mouth of the
river, but the water was so shallow that we could not get in at
the mouth. We then returned to Helena.</p>

<p>Our drill and picket duty was very heavy, as we had pickets
on the opposite side of the river. We were in all kinds of employment,
some peddling, some fishing, and some playing games.
We had a general routine of camp life.</p>

<p>November 20th, some of the 11th Indiana boys, while out
foraging were fired into by the rebels. One man was killed.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 28th, we got marching orders. We
boarded a boat and went to Delta, nine miles below. We got<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
off of the boat and marched out forty miles east, to the crossroads.
We went into camp in a bottom.</p>

<p>December 3rd, General Washburn with part of the command
marched to the railroad. Here they had a sharp skirmish with
the enemy, losing one piece of the 1st Indiana cavalry’s artillery.
This was a draw battle. We got plenty of pork and sweet potatoes
on this march.</p>

<p>On the 5th we marched back to Coldwater. The next morning
we began our march at 4 o’clock. Sunday, the 7th, we
marched three hours before day. Half of the boys didn’t get
their breakfasts that day. We reached the river and got on the
boats. We landed at Helena at 10 p. m.</p>

<p>On the 9th of December, General Gorman took command of
the post, and we had grand review. On the 11th we were reviewed
by Generals Gorman and Steel. About the 15th, some
heavy rains fell, causing the sloughs to rise, so that we had to
haul the picket guards to their posts in wagons.</p>

<p>On the 21st, General Sherman, with his army and a fleet of
gunboats, passed Helena. This army was on an expedition
against Vicksburg.</p>

<p>On the 22nd, Lieutenant Colonel Barter was appointed
Provost-marshal, and the boys of Company B of our regiment
were guards.</p>

<p>About the 25th, General Grant’s communications were cut
off while he was on an expedition against the rebels at Meridian.
This caused his failure to form a junction with Sherman at
Vicksburg. Generals Sherman and Smith with their forces
charged Haines’ Bluffs. They were repulsed with heavy loss.</p>

<p>Sherman was now reinforced by McClearnand. They went
up the Arkansas River and took the Arkansas Post, with six or
seven thousand prisoners and some heavy guns. Sherman captured
more prisoners at this place than he had lost at Vicksburg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>On the morning of January 11th, all of our troops at Helena
under Gorman, except one cavalry regiment, got on boats and
went down to the mouth of White River. We went up the river
to St. Charles which place the rebels had evacuated. On the
15th of January, 1863, a seven-inch snow fell. The canebrakes
and timber bent under their heavy loads.</p>

<p>The heavy rains had overflowed the river and it was all over
the bottom land. This together with the snow made a very
gloomy morning. That night, the pickets had been sent out with
orders not to kindle any fires. Some of them were angry and
set fire to some buildings, thus causing some excitement in camp.
The pickets were called in and we got on the boat. We went up
the river to Clarendon, and on the evening of the 16th, we landed
at Duvall’s Bluff. The rebels had just evacuated this place.
Our cavalry moved out after them and picked up a few prisoners.</p>

<p>The rebels left two sixty-four pound guns in our possession.
We loaded these on to the boats. On the morning of the 17th,
Colonel Spicely, in command of the 24th and three gunboats,
went to Desarc. This is a beautiful little town. It is about as
far up White River as navigation is carried on.</p>

<p>We found many sick and wounded rebels here. Our officers
paroled them. There was also a great deal of small arms and
ammunition here which we took.</p>

<p>January 19th, all of the command moved to St. Charles. At
night several houses were set on fire, making quite an illumination.
On the 21st we went down near Helena, but had to tie up
on account of the fog. On the morning of the 22nd, after a distance
of 540 miles had been traveled, we landed at Helena again.</p>

<p>The weather was cold and disagreeable, and we began building
winter quarters. There were to be sixteen men to a log
cabin.</p>

<p>We remained here until the 18th of February. Our camp<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
was then overflowed and we moved back from the river. We
went into camp on higher camp ground.</p>

<p>The 19th we embarked on a boat and went down the river as
far as Moon Lake. Here the levee had been blown up, and every
foot of the lowland to Yazoo City, had been flooded. In early
days this place had been called Yazoo Pass, and boats had run
along here. We crossed the lake and marched five miles. We
went into camp for the night.</p>

<p>On the 20th, we drew some cornmeal. This was quite a
treat as we were tired of hardtack. We found a mill, set her to
going, and soon had enough meal ground for a good corn cake.
Some baked their cake in half canteens, some on boards, and
others rolled the dough on a stick and held it near the fire until
it baked.</p>

<p>A cold rain had set in making a very muddy and disagreeable
time, but we had to pull the heavy trees out of the pass, which
the rebels had felled to keep our boats from going through. We
fastened two-inch cables around the butts of the trees, and pulled
them out, tops and all. Several cables broke, throwing the
boys twenty feet each way. We finished cleaning out the pass on
the second evening. We were wet and muddy all over. The
officers took pity on us and issued <ins class="corr" id="tn_49" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'a thimblefull of'">
a thimbleful of</ins> commissary whiskey to each man. Some of the boys paid twenty-five cents
a thimbleful for <ins class="corr" id="tn_49a" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'enough wiskey to'">
enough whiskey to</ins> make a good drink.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 22nd we got on the boat and went
down to the mouth of the pass. We found no more obstructions.
When we got to Coldwater River, our gunboat threw
shells into the woods on each side. We ran down this stream
twenty-five miles and tied up for the night. We could see the
signs of a great many rebel boats which had peeled the bark off
of the trees near the shore. All of this country was flooded.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 24th, our task completed, we turned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
the bow of the boat up stream. On our return, we ran up near
Moon Lake. When night set in it was so foggy that we had to
tie up for the night. The next morning we decked our boat
with holly and other evergreens and set out on our journey. We
ran into Moon Lake and here met General Quinby’s division on
their way to Fort Greenwood.</p>

<p>We returned to Helena. General Quinby moved on down
to the fort and found that country all under water. At night he
planted two guns on a small knoll near the fort. The next
morning the gunboats opened fire on the fort. The rebels threw
a shell into the port of the Benton, killing seven gunners. The
union troops then had to draw off, as they could not get to the
fort. They left the two guns which had been planted there.</p>

<p>They came back to Helena after a hard struggle to get
through to Yazoo City. All of their plans had failed.</p>

<p>General Prentice was now in charge of the post at Helena.
On the 28th of February, he issued an order for all citizens to be
sent out of our lines who would not take the oath of allegiance to
our government.</p>

<p>The river rose, overflowing our camp, and we had to move it.</p>

<p>March 14th, Company B of our regiment was relieved from
provost duty, and they returned to the regiment. Nothing of
importance occurred until the 26th of March, at which time we
received two months’ pay.</p>

<p>In the morning of April 6, 1863, we were called into line.
Our brigade marched into the fort and was addressed by
Adjutant General Thomas. He spoke in regard to arming the
negroes, as the Emancipation Act had already been passed. He
had come direct from Washington, D. C., with full authority to
arm and equip the colored troops. He advocated that it would
be much better to put the negroes up for a target to be shot at
than for us to risk all of the danger ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>This proclamation caused quite an excitement throughout the
army. Many of the boys deserted and went back home, but they
were afterwards pardoned, and came back to their regiments.
About this time we received two months’ pay.</p>

<p>April 9th, we received marching orders which were read to
us at dress parade. On the evening of the 10th we struck tents,
marched on to the boats, and went down the river four miles.
Here we joined General Quinby’s division. General Hovey was
now in command of our division. On the morning of the 12th,
our squadron moved on down the river. We went past Napoleon
at 4 o’clock in the afternoon. On the morning of the 13th, we
ran past Lake Providence, Louisiana.</p>

<p>We landed at Millikin’s Bend at 12 o’clock at noon, this being
about 210 miles below Helena. On the morning of the 14th we
went up the river two miles, got off of the boat, and went into
camp.</p>

<p>April 15th, we loaded all of our baggage on a barge and prepared
for a march. This country was low and swampy, and a
great many of our boys had died from malaria and other diseases.
Many of them were buried on the levee. Our troops had lain
here since the charge at Chickasaw Landing.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 16th we started to march around
Vicksburg. We went into camp at night near Richmond, a
small town in Madison Parish, Louisiana. The next morning
we marched twelve miles and went into camp on Dawson’s
Plantation. We remained at this place three days. Our teams
went back for rations.</p>

<p>About this time General Grant sent his Yankee gunboat past
the blockade at night. It fooled the rebel gunners and each fired
a shot at the supposed monster. As the nights were very dark,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
we could see the flashes of the guns and hear the boom of the
heavy guns which were planted on the river bluff for seven miles
in length.</p>

<p>At this place we had roll call seven times each day in order
to keep the boys in camp. On the 19th, our cavalry had a small
engagement. After they had taken a few prisoners the rebels
fell back.</p>

<p>On the 21st, we marched to Fisk’s Plantation, a distance of
about thirteen miles. We went into camp near the bayou. Grant
had been trying to open up this bayou for several months, so that
he might get the gunboats around Vicksburg. It rained all that
day making it very disagreeable.</p>

<p>There was heavy cannonading at night, as our gunboats and
transports were running the blockade. We must have been
twenty-five miles away but the roar and flashes could plainly be
heard and seen.</p>

<p>We lay here several days while our pioneers were constructing
pontoon bridges across the bayou. Here <ins class="corr" id="tn_53" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'our seige guns'">
our siege guns</ins> were brought up. They were drawn by several yoke of cattle,
as it was too muddy in that black sticky soil for horses or mules
to get through, with big loads.</p>

<p>On the 27th we resumed our march. While crossing the
bridge one of our heavy guns fell over the side of the bridge,
and went down into thirty feet of water, dragging the teams
with it. It began raining and after marching nine miles through
the rain and mud which was knee deep, we came to the banks of
the Mississippi River.</p>

<p>All of our fleet which had run the blockade at Vicksburg, lay
at this place, which we named Perkins’ Landing.</p>

<p>On the 28th, General A. P. Hovey’s division embarked on
boats and barges and went fifteen miles to Hard Times Landing,
which is five miles above Grand Gulf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>On the morning of the 29th, all of us marched on to boats
with barges lashed on either side, which were filled with troops
ready for the charge. Our squadron of ironclads, seven in number,
moved in line on down toward the rebel forts. It was a
grand sight to behold those great ironclad monsters gliding down
against this mighty fortress at Grand Gulf, with its large guns,
to receive tons of iron hail against their iron sides.</p>

<p>Everything was as still as death when we neared the fort.
Many were holding their breaths and listening for the terrible
fray to begin. On the boats went, the Benton in advance. When
she got opposite the fort, she circled round until within 150 yards
of it. She then opened up with a broadside of six heavy one
hundred pounders one after the other. Each boat followed in
succession. Scarcely had our guns opened fire when the enemy
replied with their heavy 284 pound guns.</p>

<p>The fort became a mass of fire and smoke. The Tuscumba
in the same manner as the Benton, poured in her broadside.
Next came the Baron, DeKalb, the Lafayette, the Carondalet and
so on.</p>

<p>The fort seemed to be silenced and then it was that our
brigade on a boat and two barges, moved on down with orders
to charge that American Gibraltar. We were in good spirits,
for we thought that no human life could exist in that flame of
hell and destruction, which rained over the rebels for two long
hours. All was silent, but we had run down but a short distance
when a white cloud of smoke belched out of the fort like a
volcano, and the heavy shot and shell once more poured out from
that crater.</p>

<p>One of the largest shots struck not over twenty yards from
our bow. It was not many seconds before our pilot had the bows
of our boats turned in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>We were about two miles from the fort when the battle was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
renewed, part of our gunboats running close to the fort and using
grape shot and cannister. The old Lafayette lay at a distance
of three miles up the gulf, using her big stern gun and dropping
shell directly into the fort.</p>

<p>The hog chains were cut off of the Tuscumba, and she, put
out of business, dropped down below the fort.</p>

<p>After four hours of hard fighting, our boats drew off to cool
down and rest a while. It must have been terrible for the boys
who were shut up in those iron monsters.</p>

<p>Our force landed and a detail of volunteers was called to stay
on the boats while the blockade was being run. We marched
round six miles on the west side of the river. <ins class="corr" id="tn_55" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'A 8'">
At 8</ins> o’clock we were on the river bank, five miles below Grand Gulf. At nine
o’clock our entire fleet ran the blockade. This sight will be remembered
by many persons as long as they live. We could see
tongues of fire pouring forth from the mouths of those mighty
monsters. The sound on the still night air was heard many
miles away. The earth trembled as far away as where we were
looking on. Our boats got through but they were riddled up
somewhat badly.</p>

<p>Our loss was twelve killed and wounded. The rebel loss was
twenty-six. Among their wounded was a brigadier general.
We lost six battery horses on the transports, while they were
running the blockade.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 30th we crossed the river. Our regiment
crossed on the old ironclad Benton. The marks of the shot
on her iron plates were terrible. Great pieces of shell had been
forced under her iron plates, and they were blue all over where
the minnie balls had struck and glanced off.</p>

<p>After we had crossed we drew a small amount of hardtack
and a little piece of bacon. At four o’clock we started on a
march in the direction of Port Gibson, which is seven miles back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
of Grand Gulf. We marched all night over a very rough, broken
country. At 2 o’clock on the morning of the 1st of May, we
ran into the rebel army. We were halted from our tiresome
march by the terrific sound and the crashing shell of a battery,
which broke the still morning air with its echo over hill and
valley for many miles and warned even the little birds of that
desperate day which was to come and cause so many homes to
mourn the loss of some dear friend.</p>

<p>Hovey’s division being in front, our regiment moved down
and stacked our arms in line of battle. We were not farther than
100 yards from a concealed line of rebels. They lay in a canebrake.
Everything was as still as death and this was the darkest
part of the night, the hour just before day. Our regiment was
ordered to move to the right and form the right wing of our line
of battle so that the troops in the rear might come up and form
in line. But before our lines were formed, that ravine and canebrake
became a solid sheet of fire, caused by the rebel batteries
and small arms. Daylight was now beginning to break and we
could see that the shells were playing havoc with our troops on
the hill, that were forcing their way up to the front to form our
lines.</p>

<p>We had stacked our guns and the boys were trying to make
some coffee, but the battery in front seeing that the hungry boys
needed some heat to make their coffee boil quickly, rolled in a
few shells and blew all of the fire out. Some of the boys swearing,
declared that it had come from our own guns, for the shell
came directly from the place where we had stacked our arms that
morning.</p>

<p>The fight was now on in earnest, and there was no time for
arguing about the matter. We now piled our knapsacks and
prepared for the charge.</p>

<p>General Osterhos had charged in front, and our regiment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
charged down across a large ravine, which was grown up with
cane, making it almost impassable. The rattle of shot and shell
striking the cane and the whoops and yells of the charging regiments
made a terrible noise.</p>

<p>We moved across and supported the 8th Indiana, which was
commanded by General Benton. The rebels gave way on all
parts of their lines and fell back. We then moved up and supported
a battery in the edge of a big plantation. They were
shelling the rebels on the retreat. Some old houses were near
by and the rebel batteries were knocking the chinking and
splinters in all directions.</p>

<p>We followed up the retreat five miles. We found everything
imaginable scattered along the road. The rebels halted and
formed their lines in the timber near Port Gibson. We moved
up within a mile of their lines, halted, and stacked our arms, to
take a rest.</p>

<p>At two o’clock, the rebels were reinforced by General Tracy
and Green, who had fresh forces, and they were also good fighters.
We could see them coming down on us in as nice a line
as was ever seen in any army. We then had to get busy, and in
a hurry too. We advanced to meet the enemy. Our regiment
stopped at a ditch. The 47th Indiana and the 19th Kentucky
stayed with us.</p>

<p>When the rebel line got within forty yards of us their men
fell to the ground and remained there one and one-fourth hours,
before we repulsed them. We averaged fifty-eight rounds of
cartridges to the man before the rebels withdrew. After that
we never grumbled about carrying sixty rounds of cartridges.</p>

<p>After General Tracy and many others had been slain, the
rebels fell back demoralized. Very many of their men had been
slain and wounded. Our regiment had only thirty-four killed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
and wounded, as we were protected by the ditch, and did not
suffer like other regiments.</p>

<p>The fighting along the line was kept up until five o’clock in
the evening when the rebels fell back, some by the way of Grand
Gulf and the others in the direction of Vicksburg. At two
o’clock on the morning of the 2nd of May we were awakened by
the jar and report of the exploding magazines which were blown
up at Grand Gulf, when the rebels evacuated that strong fortress.
We could see their signals going up all night, and thought that
the rebels meant to concentrate their forces and fight a pitched
battle with us, on the next day, but they saw that we had come
to stay and decided that it would be better for them to take all
of their men to Vicksburg.</p>

<p>Now it could plainly be seen that nothing could hold the
blockade of the Mississippi against our mighty force of ironclads
and the army which had undertaken to open it up.</p>

<p>Our loss at Port Gibson was 500 killed and wounded. The
rebel loss was about 600 killed and wounded and we also took
700 of their men as prisoners. The divisions that were engaged
at this place were A. P. Hovey’s, Osterhos’, and Carr’s. Logan’s
division came up just at dark, and Quinby’s division did not get
into the fight at all.</p>

<p>May 2, 1863, we moved into Port Gibson. Here we had to
wait until a pontoon bridge could be constructed over Bayou
Pierre, as the rebels had burned the bridges, while on their retreat.</p>

<p>Our boys found many valuables, such as watches, jewelry,
silverware, and some gold and silver coin at this place. We also
found plenty of good bacon which was buried in hogsheads and
sodded over. This came in good play as our rations were getting
slim. The citizens all seemed to be in mourning. Many of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
them had their property burned on the supposition that they had
fought us the day before.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 3rd, our regiment crossed the bayou,
and marched out six miles in the direction of Grand Gulf on a
scout. We found plenty of bacon and other articles of food,
which the rebels had concealed in the woods, but they were not
sharp enough to hide anything from a yankee.</p>

<p>At two o’clock we started back, but when we came to the
Jackson road we learned that our entire army had moved on.
We then followed up as a rear guard.</p>

<p>We marched twelve miles and went into camp near Rocky
Springs. Our army had nothing to eat and we were cut off
from our base of supplies. Thus we had to forage off of the
country. We foraged corn and ran one or two mills, and this
furnished a half pint of meal to the man. Some made bread
and cooked it on coals and others rolled the dough on sticks and
baked it, and still others mixed water and meal together, making
mush without any salt. At least we had a time to get something
to satisfy our gnawing stomachs.</p>

<p>We lay here until the evening of the 6th when we moved up
eight miles. We went into camp and drew one cracker to the
man, for supper, but we had plenty of water to wash it down
with.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 7th we moved up three miles and
formed on the line of battle which was being established. Our
cavalry had a sharp skirmish and took twelve prisoners. We
had grand review by General Grant.</p>

<p>Sherman’s corps arrived on the 10th. We marched ten miles
and went into camp. Sherman’s corps passed us late in the
evening and went into camp two miles in advance of us. This
was near the enemy’s line of battle and we looked for a heavy
battle at any moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>On the morning of the 12th we marched on past Sherman’s
division. After a march of five miles we came up with our
cavalry command, which was engaged in a sharp little fight with
the rebel advance. We drove them back to the main Vicksburg
army near Edward’s Depot.</p>

<p>We crossed Baker’s Creek and went into the camp for the
night. We were so near the rebels that we could hear them talk
at night, and our teamsters and their cavalry got corn at the same
cribs, between our lines. While our teamster of company A,
Timothy Riggle, was in the crib filling his sack, a squad of rebel
cavalry came to the door.</p>

<p>One of the rebels looked in and called out, “Boys, heah is a
d&mdash;&mdash; yank in heah stealing ouah cohn.” Then this to the
yankee, “Get out of heah.”</p>

<p>Our teamster hardly knew how to answer, but he replied,
“Gentlemen, please give me time to get a few more ears. My
mules are nearly starved.”</p>

<p>When they heard him call them gentlemen they gave him a
little time. I suppose that they had never been called gentlemen
before. But the teamster didn’t take time to fill his sack. He
was glad to change places with the rebs, and feed his mules on
half rations. When he came into camp with his hair standing
on end, and reported his escape from prison, the Captain said to
him, “Bully for you, Tim.”</p>

<p>That night Sherman, with his corps passed to our rear, and
went with all speed toward Raymond. On the morning of the
13th we heard the batteries of Sherman’s force open up on the
rebel army at Raymond.</p>

<p>During the night the rebels had concentrated a large force
with the expectation of a general fight the next morning. But
at daybreak when they heard the noise of Sherman’s batteries at
Raymond, they came down on us like demons. The bullets flew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
thick and fast but the most of them went too high as we were
under the hill.</p>

<p>As we had only a small detachment against the main rebel
army, we were ordered to fall in line and pull out on double
quick time.</p>

<p>I will relate a little circumstance which took place while we
were in this critical position. In forming our lines we were
ordered to left wheel into line. One of our old comrades by
the name of John Lochner, who was a very clumsy Dutchman,
slipped on a pile of rails and peeled all of the skin off of half of
his nose. He was standing there cursing in Dutch and the Captain
seeing him with the blood running down his face, yelled out,
“Lochner, if you are shot, go to the ambulance.”</p>

<p>“Shoot, hell Ciptain, shoot mit a rail in de nose.” he replied.
But he stayed in his place in the ranks anyway.</p>

<p>We crossed the creek and were soon out of the range of the
rebels’ bullets. A very heavy rain set in making a hard muddy
march. Seeing the rebels did not follow us, we crossed over
Baker’s Creek on a bridge and then set the bridge on fire. We
went into camp in the bottom.</p>

<p>That night we tore down some cotton pens and each fellow
had a good, soft, cotton bed. But just as a person thinks that
he is getting some great pleasure for himself, death and destruction
come along and cut off his happiness. About 10 o’clock that
night, we were almost washed out of that camp by a flood. We
waded to the hills in water that was sometimes waist deep.</p>

<p>On the 14th, we marched through Raymond. Here we passed
over the battleground. It bore the marks of a hard fought battle.
In the fight <ins class="corr" id="tn_61" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Sheman had taken'">
Sherman had taken</ins> several prisoners, but he
had lost 500 men, killed and wounded. He had gone on to Jackson,
the capital of Mississippi.</p>

<p>We, tired and hungry, marched on through rain and mud.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
At the end of twelve miles, we went into camp we knew not
where. But one thing we did know. That was that we were
tolerably well mixed up with a large rebel army and would have
to untangle soon.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 15th, we began marching at six
o’clock, and after a distance of five miles had been traveled we
came to a little town on the Jackson and Vicksburg Railroad, by
the name of Clinton. The distance to Jackson from here was
eighteen miles. We received a dispatch from General Sherman
stating that he had captured the town of Jackson, captured
several prisoners, and put General Johnson’s rebel army to flight.</p>

<p>Our army consisting of Hovey’s and Logan’s divisions turned
back toward Vicksburg. We were foraging along the road as
many of the boys had empty haversacks, and not a morsel to eat.
I jumped over into a garden and grabbed a few onions. The
other boys followed my example and soon the garden was cleaned
up. I had procured a small amount of Orleans molasses and
when we stopped for a short rest I made my breakfast on onions
and molasses. I will always remember that I enjoyed that breakfast
more than any that I ever ate.</p>

<p>We were soon called into line and we began our march again.
After a march of ten miles we ran into the rebel’s advance guard,
near Bolton’s Depot. Our cavalry drove the picket in and we
formed a line of battle. We stacked our guns for we were
hungry. As soon as our guns were stacked, we were out looking
for something to eat, just anything to stop the gnawing at our
weak stomachs. Two of my messmates, John Clark and John
Toliver, and I ran for a house down in the field. When we got
to the house we saw an old French lady standing on the portico,
with a large bull dog tied to the post.</p>

<p>The old lady forbade our coming inside, but we could not
understand her gibberish, and even if we could, we were too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
hungry to pay any attention. There was a smokehouse on the
place and we could smell the delicious odor which the good hams
hanging in there made. We knocked the gate down, and while I
was having a battle with the dog the boys went for the meat.
The dog placed his feet on my breast, but I had my bayonet in the
scabbard and I grabbed the dog with my left hand and with my
right hand I ran my bayonet through the dog’s ribs. This made
the old lady jump up and down and swear like a trooper. I
met the boys coming out of the smokehouse with two big hams
on their shoulders. One of them called out, “We have plenty
of meat, Fulfer, you get the honey.” The old lady came with
an ax and I saw that something had to be done. As quickly as
possible, I grabbed up a large bee stand that was open at the
bottom, and threw it on my shoulder. At last the battle was
won. The last time that I saw that old French woman, she was
flying through the door with the yard full of angry bees after
her. There was at least seventy-five pounds of honey in that
gum.</p>

<p>Just at this critical moment the rebel cavalry drove our
cavalry back. The bullets rattled through the cornstalks and
past us like hail. Toliver called back at the top of his voice,
“Hold on to that bee gum, Fulfer.” When we got back to the
regiment all of the boys were in line of battle ready for business.</p>

<p>We camped here that night and the two different cavalries
were skirmishing at intervals all through the night. Some of
company A will always remember that we had honey and ham
that night for supper.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>


<p>On the morning of the 16th of May, 1863, a day long to be
remembered by some of us. We were called into line at an early
hour, but some time elapsed before the plan of the march was
decided upon by the generals. Finally Osterhos and Carr moved
by the way of Raymond, and Hovey and Logan by the way of
Champion Hill. General Quinby was in the rear guarding the
trains.</p>

<p>After we had advanced a few miles we met some straggling
rebels who reported that the rebels were in full force on the Raymond
Road, but had pitched their battle ground on Champion
Hill, near the forks of the road.</p>

<p>After a six-mile march we ran up against the rebels, posted in
a natural fortification, made by the circling road that curved
round the hill. Logan moved his division up and took a position
on the extreme right flank, in line of battle. Hovey’s division
was formed next to Logan’s and Osterhos’, Carr’s and
Smith’s division were on the left on the Raymond Road.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock Company A was ordered on to the skirmish
line. We charged up within sixty yards of the main rebel line
which was formed in the edge of the woods. This brought on
the engagement and it was general all along the lines of Logan
and Hovey. Our company having one man wounded, while
getting here, fell down in a hollow. The air above us was blue,
and the roaring of the guns and the whizzing of shot and shell
was fearful.</p>

<p>At one time I thought that Company A was lost. The rebels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
in a solid mass, charged one of Logan’s batteries, which was 150
yards to our right and rear. They were repulsed with great
slaughter, and they were driven back past us faster than they had
come. It was terrible to look upon the slaughter of that desperate
charge. The only musket balls which I ever saw used, were
at this place. By the use of them the rebels in our front tried
to shell us out of that hollow ravine.</p>

<p>The 11th Indiana and 29th Wisconsin of our brigade charged
on our left, driving the rebels out of the road. They also captured
a battery and took 160 prisoners. General Logan’s division
charged on our right, and drove the enemy in a mass, back
in front of Hovey’s division. There was cheering all along the
line because the boys thought that we had the rebels routed. But
they had only fallen back to mask their forces and draw Hovey’s
division into a trap.</p>

<p>Our regiment moved up and gave three cheers on account of
holding our part of the skirmish line so near the enemy. Our
company joined on to our regiment and moved two hundred
yards to the left flank at the top of the hill. This was where the
11th Indiana had taken a battery.</p>

<p>We faced the enemy and charged down the hill. On we
went, unmindful of the death and destruction which we were
running into. Not a shot was fired to warn us of the danger,
until we were in nineteen steps of a masked division. Fifteen to
one hundred of them came up out of the ditches. They were to
our right flank and rear, not over 200 yards from where we had
started down the hill.</p>

<p>Regiment after regiment poured death and destruction into
our ranks until we had only a little squad left, to rally around
the flag. At the first volley the most of our little battalion fell,
dead and wounded. I dropped into a ditch and loaded and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
fired three shots at the rebels. They were so close that I could
see the whites of their eyes.</p>

<p>It seemed as though the hill was filled with rebels. On they
came and I had to get up and change my position. When about
half way up the hill, I ran into a squad fighting hand to hand.
Here was the place where the old 24th almost lost its flag, and
also, Colonel Barter almost lost his hand. The colors were shot
out of it and the flag staff was split into three pieces. Corporal
Steel carried the flag off of the field.</p>

<p>We could not get reinforcements and the chance of any of us
being saved was a forlorn hope, but just at the last moment, we
were saved by reinforcements. They came into line on the right
at the top of the hill. We were a mixed up bunch, but those
brave Missouri and Iowa boys, the 3rd, 5th and 6th Missouri and
the 10th Iowa, saved us. When the rebel host saw our solid line
of reinforcements they became panic stricken. They were so
excited that the last load that they fired they did not return their
ramrods, but fired them into our faces, threw down their guns,
and fled for safe quarters.</p>

<p>We had won the day, but Hovey’s and Logan’s divisions had
paid dearly for their prize. At four o’clock the enemy fell back
in confusion. They were being hard pressed on all parts of the
lines and they made no stand until they reached Black River
Bridge, which place they had well fortified.</p>

<p>The rebels, on their retreat, had left many dead to be buried
in fence corners.</p>

<p>Our division, commanded by General A. P. Hovey, was composed
of the following troops: the 11th, 24th, 34th, 46th and
47th Indiana; 29th Wisconsin; 24th Iowa; 56th Ohio; and 22nd
Kentucky.</p>

<p>The loss of our division was 1,500 killed and wounded. The
loss in our regiment was 259. Our company loss was 22. Two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
of our boys were taken prisoners. The number of men when
we went into the charge had been 480. Our brigade having
suffered the greatest loss, was left on the field to care for the
wounded and bury the dead.</p>

<p>At night a heavy picket was placed around the battlefield,
for fear that the rebel general, Loring, who had cut through our
lines, would come back and make a night attack on our little
worn-out force that had been left on the field of battle.</p>

<p>No person except those who were pickets on that field, that
dark night, can imagine the horrors of that awful bloody field of
death and destruction. The groans of hundreds of wounded
and dying could be heard on the still night air, and one could
imagine that they saw them in their mangled condition, begging
for water and calling on God for help. “War is hell.”</p>

<p>The rebel loss at Champion Hill had been as heavy as our
own, and we also captured 4,000 of their men as prisoners, and
took twenty-two pieces of their artillery.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 17th, the still air was disturbed by
the belching cannon at Black River Bridge. Osterhos and Logan
charged the works at daylight, driving the rebels out and putting
them to fight in the direction of Vicksburg, their last stronghold.
Several prisoners and four pieces of artillery were taken. The
enemy set the bridge on fire, thus checking the advance of the
union forces. But they were not to be hindered in that way, for
they were soon crossing on pontoons. On the morning of the
18th General Grant was forming his lines around Vicksburg.</p>

<p>May 19th, 1863, having cared for the wounded and buried
the dead, our little shattered brigade took up our line of march.
After a march of ten miles we came to Black River Bridge.</p>

<p>General Sherman crossed Black River some distance above
here on his return from the capture of Jackson, Mississippi.
On the night of the 19th, he charged the enemy at Haines Bluffs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
where he had been defeated about the 23rd of December, the
year before. This time he was successful in capturing the fort.
He then established his lines on our extreme right. The capturing
of Haines Bluffs connected us with our base of supplies
above Pittsburg. We had been on less than quarter rations for
twenty days.</p>

<p>At Haines Bluffs, Sherman captured several prisoners and
took some heavy guns. He also forced the enemy back to their
main defenses at Vicksburg.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 20th, we took up our line of march.
We left Black River Bridge at 4 p. m. We marched until
twelve o’clock at night. We moved up near our troops which
were establishing their lines around Vicksburg.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>


<p>On the 20th, our troops had had a hard little fight but were
repulsed by the rebels, after they had charged up close to the
strong rebel forts. On the 21st we moved up near our advance
lines and on the 22nd a general charge all along the lines was
ordered. Our regiment supported the 7th Kentucky.</p>

<p>Several of our regiments in front had planted their flags on
the rebel forts and the destruction of men was horrible. The
earth trembled under the powerful explosives. Many of our
boys were slain in hand to hand fights.</p>

<p>From some unknown cause, the rebel army in our front was
reinforced and we were driven back with a heavy loss. The
blame was laid to General McClernand, the commander of our
13th corps. He was superceded and I never heard of him afterwards.
He was a fine looking general. Thus the name of the
13th corps was lost at Vicksburg.</p>

<p>The nurses and wounded whom we had left at Champion
Hill, had been captured but were paroled. They came to us
about this time.</p>

<p>Our troops were driven back and some of the regiments lost
their flags. At night some of the wounded were carried away
but the rebs would shoot at any little noise. Many of the
wounded perished that night for want of help.</p>

<p>During all of the siege. Admiral Porter bombarded the city
with twenty-two inch mortars and other heavy guns. It was a
sight to see those huge shells raised to the distance of four miles,
and then explode and send the pieces of shell humming to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
ground, and making a noise like thunder.</p>

<p>On the 24th, we went to work digging rifle pits and preparing
for the siege. Our large guns kept up a continuous firing all
along the lines.</p>

<p>On the 25th, our dead, who had fallen in the charge of the
22nd, had not yet been buried. The rebels had refused to let
us bury them. But the corpses stunk them out and they gave
us a four hour’s armistice in which to bury the dead.</p>

<p>Two of those in our regiment were wounded while working
in the rifle pits. We were relieved from this duty by the second
brigade. We then moved back in a deep hollow to rest.</p>

<p>On the 26th we moved up to support the first regular siege
guns. Our duty was heavy skirmishing all day and digging
rifle pits and planting batteries at night.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 28th our batteries opened a heavy fire
all along the line. They blew up one of the rebel’s magazines,
thus causing a terrible explosion. The rebels returned fire but
after an hour of heavy bombarding they were silenced. On the
30th, a small dram of commissary whisky was issued all along the
line.</p>

<p>On the 31st we took our position on the lines where we remained
until the surrender. Osterhos moved his brigade back
to Black River and began building breastworks to protect our
rear.</p>

<p>The rebel generals, Johnson and Breckenridge, had come up
with forty thousand men to raise the siege.</p>

<p>On the morning of the first day of June, 1863, our troops
were stationed on the lines as follows: General Herring on our
extreme left flank, next to the Mississippi River; General Lawman’s
division joined on to them; our division, under General
Hovey next; the first brigade of General Osterhos’ troops, next,
which brigade reached the Vicksburg and Jackson Railroad;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
Generals Carr, Smith, and Quinby next came in; General Logan’s
corps was fronting that strong fort called “The Queen of Vicksburg,”
which afterwards became the noted part of the drama
of Vicksburg; next General McPherson; and General Sherman’s
corps as has already been stated, took their place on the extreme
right at Haines’ Bluffs, near the Yazoo River. We were reinforced
by Burnsides’ ninth corps, which was moved back to
strengthen our rear, and Osterhos’ second brigade, and to fortify
the banks of Black River.</p>

<p>We now had one hundred thousand troops in this vicinity.
General Logan’s troops began tunneling under the largest fort
at Vicksburg that morning. The rebels opened up with several
of their heavy guns but they were soon silenced as we were advancing
our rifle pits in close range and our sharpshooters were
getting to be good marksmen.</p>

<p>At night General Lawman’s division tried to advance their
rifle pits, and the rebels in front opposed their advance. There
were several hard charges made on both sides. The rebels
would drive our boys out of the pits and fill them up and then
Lawman’s men would charge back and open up the rifle pits
again. It was quite an exciting scene to witness.</p>

<p>Everything was quiet in front of Hovey’s division, but we
were looking for the rebels to oppose our advance at night. On
the morning of the second of June, our army was digging wells
all along the line to supply us with water. We got plenty of
water at a depth of eighteen feet.</p>

<p>The rebel batteries opened up a heavy cannonading, but our
boys soon silenced them. On the morning of the third we were
still advancing our rifle pits and the rebels were getting in a few
shots with their big guns. They were now getting short of
ammunition and were loading their guns with pieces of our
mortar shells and railroad iron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>Breckenridge, the rebel, had forty thousand men at our rear,
but we were too well fortified for him to make an attack. On
the eighth a force of rebel cavalry attacked our guards and sick
at Millikin’s Bend, but they were repulsed and driven back with
a slight loss.</p>

<p>On the 11th a continual firing was kept up all day. One
man in Company B of our regiment was killed. He was hit in
the back with a piece of one of our own shells, while he was lying
on his bunk.</p>

<p>On the 12th a detail from our regiment planted some heavy
eighty-four pound guns in our rear and fifteen thousand men
were sent back to Black River to reinforce our rear guard which
was looking for an attack every hour, as things were getting
desperate with the rebel army which was cooped up in Vicksburg.</p>

<p>On the 14th the rebels opened fire with some small mortars,
on General Herring’s troops. Several were killed and wounded
by mortar shells. They also threw some shells into Logan’s
division.</p>

<p>At night some of our boys met the rebs half way between
our lines and exchanged coffee for the papers which the rebels
were printing in Vicksburg. We found much valuable information
in these papers.</p>

<p>Since they had been cooped up in Vicksburg, the rebels had
been in communication with Breckenridge’s army by means of
some spies. We also often traded coffee with the rebels for
tobacco or something which we wanted, while we were on picket
duty.</p>

<p>On the 16th the rebels opened fire with some of their heavy
guns on our rifle pits which we were advancing within a short
distance of their forts. But they were soon silenced by our
sharpshooters.</p>

<p>On the 17th, a battery of our twenty-four pound siege guns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
threw hot shot into the city and tried to set the houses on fire, but
they failed to do much damage, as the buildings were so far
apart. The most of them had been pounded down by Porter’s
big mortar shells, and very many of the citizens had dug out
houses in the railroad cut, sixty feet below the top of the ground.
Some of the houses had been dug out in solid rock and they were
proof against Porter’s big shells that rolled to the height of four
miles, then dropped and went into the ground fifteen feet, then
they exploded and tore out holes in the ground as large as a
house.</p>

<p>It seemed impossible for any living being to exist in such a
hell through forty-eight days in the presence of those death-dealing
monsters. The earth and air were both filled with iron and
lead.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 18th, our company was relieved out
of the rifle pits by Companies C and E. While we were yet
standing there two of the boys were killed by rebel sharpshooters.
One was out of Company C and the other out of Company E.
The bullets passed through the loop in our head logs and then
went through the boys’ heads. We were only sixty yards from
the fort at this time. Admiral Porter used his fleet of mortars
and ironclads continually. There was neither rest nor quiet during
those hot days, made still hotter by the whizzing shells and
zipping minnie balls.</p>

<p>On the 23rd we received two months’ pay. We now had
money and could catch a little time to bet on our old familiar
game called chuck-a-luck.</p>

<p>General Logan’s men had their tunnel underneath the “Queen
of Vicksburg” completed. On the morning of the 25th, we received
orders for every man to fire fifty rounds of cartridges and
each battery to fire one hundred rounds, all along the entire line.
Just imagine eighty thousand anxious men, standing in the rifle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
pits, awaiting orders and ready to charge the mighty Gibraltar of
Vicksburg.</p>

<p>Everything was quiet and not a sound disturbed the still air.
Many were thinking of home and God and wondering what was
coming next. About ten o’clock we saw a cloud of black smoke
go up like the upheaval of a volcano. It carried with it to the
height of a mile, hundreds of tons of earth and debris and a great
number of men. This was followed by a mighty shaking of the
earth, and the “Queen of Vicksburg” was no more. She was
up in midair with hundreds of mangled human bodies dropping
back to the earth.</p>

<p>At this moment five hundred cannon and eighty thousand
small arms opened fire, and every man yelled at the top of his
voice. Just think for a moment what a panorama this must
have been. In five minutes nothing could be heard except the
crash and roar nor could anything be seen on account of the
smoke. Sheets of flame and clouds of black smoke shot up from
the mouths of those great monster guns.</p>

<p>After an hour of work in this awful scene of death and
destruction the lines all ceased firing. A few rebels in front of
us gave three cheers to let us know that they were not all dead.
The destruction then continued in Logan’s division, and it lasted
until after dark.</p>

<p>I cannot give a full account of the work of destruction that
went on in that division because I was not there, and got only a
brief sketch of the horrors in that awful crater. After the explosion
of the fort, Logan’s men charged in and tried to make an
opening in that terrible place. They fought the rebels hand to
hand, and both sides used hand grenades. These caused a great
destruction on both sides. The rebels were reinforced and
drove our men out, capturing several prisoners.</p>

<p>On the 26th, we moved one section of Captain Foster’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
twenty-pound Parrot guns into our rifle pits, not over one hundred
yards from the main rebel forts. We had to put collars
on the guns to protect the eyes of our gunners.</p>

<p>Hard fighting was going on between Logan’s division and
the rebels. They were fighting for the possession of the crater
which was blown out between the two armies. They used all
kinds of devices for holding that “bone of contention.” At
night General Hovey had our rifle pits extended to within forty
paces of their large fort. The rebels opened on us with canister,
but it took no effect as our works were too strong.</p>

<p>At night our pickets and the rebels stood only ten feet apart
and talked to each other. When four o’clock came, the first one
that got into the rifle pits fired at the other, sometimes cutting
the dirt close to his heels as he went over into the ditch on his
head. He then lay there panting for breath.</p>

<p>The rebels built a wire fence and defied us to cross it. On
the night of the 28th Captain Jackson of our pioneer corps and
a working squad advanced our pits as far the fence. The rebel
pickets were called into the fort and several shots fired. We
then sent for reinforcements. The commander of the fort called
out to know who the officer was who dared to intrude on his
rights. We were now within thirty feet of the fort and were
lying under two big guns whose muzzles one could crawl into.</p>

<p>Our captain answered the rebel thus, “Sir, I am Captain
Jackson of the pioneer corps, and have orders from U. S. Grant
to dig you out of here, and who are you, sir?”</p>

<p>“I am Colonel Jackson of the 20th Alabama Confederate,
and have my orders form General Pemberton to blow you out
of existence if you cross that wire fence.”</p>

<p>They met each other between the lines, shook hands, and had
a long interview, for they proved to be uncle and nephew. I
thought that we were in for it that night when their picket was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
called in and I heard the gunner call out, “Double shot with
cannister, Number Four.” But now all was settled and we
rested in our rifle pit until morning.</p>

<p>On the 29th the rebels planted a heavy gun to dismount our
twenty-four pounders, that lay to our rear. They had fired two
shots which took no effect, when one of our twenty-pound Parrots
in the rifle pit threw a shot which knocked the rebel gun out of
existence.</p>

<p>July 1, 1863, the rebels made a charge on part of McArthur’s
division, but they were driven back into their works, with a
counter charge. They lost thirty killed and taken prisoners.
They also charged out on Lawman’s advance, capturing and filling
up several rifle pits. They covered up several of our
wounded, who perished before we recaptured the pits. That
part of the line was reinforced and we established our line nearer
their fort.</p>

<p>On the 3rd, we advanced our works by sapping and mining.
We dug up some negro skeletons as this had been a negro graveyard.
We were building ladders and preparing for a general
charge. We could throw clods of dirt into the rebel’s forts.
They had planted several mines under our rifle pits by digging
tunnels.</p>

<p>We all knew that something was going to happen, as this kind
of warfare could not last much longer.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock, on the morning of the 3rd of July, a flag of
truce came out from the rebel lines, and was received at General
Grant’s headquarters. Then came the order to cease firing all
along the line for a three hours’ armistice. But Porter, who had
not received the order, kept his big mortars busy, and threw
some large pieces of shell over the rebels, and into our lines.</p>

<p>This rest was a good thing for all of us. Both rebel and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
union troops sat up on our works and talked over the business of
the day.</p>

<p>This is a day long to be remembered by many, both of the
North and the South. At twelve o’clock at noon both armies
resumed their places in the works and renewed that long struggle,
but the firing was not as heavy as it had been.</p>

<p>At six o’clock in the evening, we saw the second flag of truce
and firing ceased all around the lines. On the morning of the
4th of July, at eight o’clock, a salute of eight blank cartridges
was shot from each heavy gun all along the line. At nine o’clock
General Pemberton and his staff rode out and met General Grant
under a large live oak tree, near the lines. Here Grant accepted
the surrender of Vicksburg with twenty-seven thousand prisoners,
fifty thousand stands of small arms and three hundred and
fifty pieces of artillery.</p>

<p>White flags went up on each fort and the rebels marched out
and stacked their guns. Yanks and rebs were soon all mixed up
and talking as sociably as if nothing had happened. They were
almost starved and soon we were all at the same tables, eating a
good square meal of hardtack, sow belly and coffee.</p>

<p>Later I went inside their works and found several kettles of
poor mule beef, cooking on fires back of their forts. It was horrible
to witness the sights in the town, especially the hospitals.
It did not take long to get enough of sight seeing for the rotten
smell in that hole of death was terrible.</p>

<p>General Grant soon went to Washington, D. C. to receive
thanks and congratulations for the part he had taken in putting
down the rebellion, and General Sherman took temporary command
of the army at Vicksburg.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">From the History of D. H. Montgomery.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>On the Mississippi, Vicksburg and vicinity was held by a
strong Confederate force under General Pemberton. Early in
the spring of 1863, General J. E. Johnson, then at Chattanooga,
Tennessee, moved with an army to join Pemberton. In a number
of masterly battles, Grant defeated Pemberton before Johnson
could unite with him. He forced Pemberton to retreat into
Vicksburg, and drove Johnson off of the field.</p>

<p>For several weeks Grant and Sherman, with over seventy
thousand, besieged Vicksburg. Union men were shelling the
city night and day. Food was so scarce that the Confederates
had but one cracker a day. The town was so knocked to pieces
that women and children had to live in caves, dug in the earth.
They too were reduced to a few mouthsful of food a day. Mule
steaks gave out and many had to choose between eating cats and
rats.</p>

<p>Out of less than thirty thousand, they had six thousand sick
and wounded. They could hold out no longer and July 4th,
1863, Vicksburg surrendered. Grant took nearly thirty-two
thousand prisoners. Union loss, twenty-three thousand three.
Rebel loss, twenty thousand four hundred and fifty-one.</p>

<p>Among those that took part in that day of celebration and victory
was the war eagle, Old Abe, the hero of many battles. He
was carried on a perch, near the flag, by one of the color bearers
of the 8th Wisconsin.</p>

<p>At two o’clock in the evening we received marching orders to
go to the rear after Johnson’s and Breckenridge’s army. There
was a routine of work to do here, such as cleaning up and granting
paroles to prisoners, but we had troops enough to see after
all of this.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 5th, we moved out to Black River,
which was twelve miles distant. We had some strong fortifications
at this place. We lay here until the morning of the 7th
when we moved out in the direction of Jackson.</p>

<p>We stopped at the battlefield of Champion Hill for an hour’s
rest. There was hardly a living tree on the field. Those fine,
large magnolias had been torn and shot up until the place looked
like an old deadening. One could see the dead leaves for miles.
We found several bodies off of which the rain had washed the
dirt. Not much pains were taken in burying the dead rebels,
while we were at this place.</p>

<p>We moved on twelve miles to Bolton’s Depot, and here ran
into Breckenridge’s rear. After a few shots had been fired from
our batteries the enemy fell back. We lay here until 5 p. m. on
the 8th when we moved out against the rebels. They contended
for every foot of ground. We drove them about six miles and
then lay down for a short sleep.</p>

<p>On the 9th we marched to Clinton. On the morning of the
10th we moved out in the direction of Jackson. There was
skirmishing all the way but this did not annoy us very much for
we were used to skirmishing.</p>

<p>We went into camp near where Sherman was forming his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
lines. The rebels were keeping up a constant firing from their
guns. Our cavalry cut off a train of ammunition belonging to
the rebels, and then they blew up three carloads of their powder
and fixed shell to keep us from capturing it. This made a terrible
explosion.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 11th, General Hovey’s division had
orders to take our position in the line of battle. Our regiment,
the 24th Indiana, went in advance. After a march of three miles
we ran into a body of rebels, posted in the edge of the timber, a
mile from their fortifications. Part of our battalion moved out
through the timber and looked for a road to move out and flank
them. We drove their pickets in and returned to regiment to
await reinforcements.</p>

<p>Soon a battery came up and unlimbered. They fired several
shots at the rebels at the top of the hill. We then formed in line
of battle and had quite a skirmish before the rebels fell back.
We moved up to open field which was planted to corn, and just
in good roasting ears. We could see the enemy going in double
quick time for their fort as our batteries were pouring their
shell into them. Our division moved down near the railroad
and halted. At 5 p. m. the rebels opened fire on us with several
large guns, making it pretty hot for us. This firing lasted until
night. The shells cut through all parts of our lines. We lay
here all night without any thing to eat and with no protection
from shot and shell, as this was a comparatively level country.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 12th we again fell in line and moved
up within two hundred and fifty yards of their main fortification.
It was built of cotton bales and earth and made a strong fort. A
deep ditch was on the outside.</p>

<p>Here we had some sharp fighting. We were in some black
oak bushes and the bullets and shells, as they passed through,
made all sorts of noises. At 2 p. m., General Lawman’s division<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
came up and formed on our right. General Lawman, without
orders charged the enemy. He got within twenty yards of their
strong works, but they were reinforced and drove Lawman’s
brave boys back with a heavy loss of four hundred, the most of
them killed outright. Lawman’s command was taken from him
and the division was placed under our general, A. P. Hovey.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 13th, the rebel cavalry had captured
our pioneer train. They tried to burn our tools, but our cavalry
drove them off and saved part of them. They were soon brought
up and distributed, a pick and two shovels to the company.</p>

<p>We soon got busy and fair earthworks were thrown up.
You cannot find many lazy soldiers where the bullets are cutting
as close as they did there. While one of the boys was lying on
top of the pit, a piece of shell struck him some place in the rear
and tore all the hind part of his pants off. Another boy in Company
B was hit in the shoulder.</p>

<p>We had just finished our breastworks when all of the rebel
batteries in front of us got range of us and shelled us like fury
until darkness set in.</p>

<p>As we had had nothing to eat since the morning of the 12th,
each company had three men detailed to go back one mile in the
rear and pack up rations for the regiment. These men would
come running back to our rifle pits, loaded down with camp
kettles, filled with coffee and roasting ears. We were glad to
see them coming for we all had good appetites.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 14th the smell of our dead comrades
near the rebel works became so bad that they could bear it no
longer. They sent a flag of truce and requested a few hours in
which to cover the dead which fell in Lawman’s charge of the
12th. They had refused to let us get near their works to bury
our dead. We had carried off a part of our wounded at night,
but many of them had perished. They were in the troops from
Illinois.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>A few hours armistice was given. The rebels piled our dead
in ditches and merely covered them to keep them from stinking
them out of their fortifications. They didn’t get half of them
covered before the firing was resumed.</p>

<p>All on both sides were busy and each man was trying to see
how many shots he could fire.</p>

<p>I was on the picket line that evening, and while lying behind
a good-sized pine tree, my eyes were almost knocked out by bark
and splinters. Some of the best marksmanship which I ever saw
was at this place.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 15th, our lines extended from the
bank of Pearl River, above the town, to the river below, and we
were crossing a division five miles above. The division on our
left made a charge and gained the rebels’ works, but they could
not hold them on account of the heavily masked batteries. The
works here were almost as strong as the works at Vicksburg.
The rebels made a counter charge, but were repulsed with great
slaughter. Several charges were made later on in the evening,
but none of them were successful.</p>

<p>On the 16th our division lost fifty men killed and wounded.
Volley after volley was fired that night all around the line, and
our heavy guns kept up a continual fire. The rebel bands played
“Dixie” and “The Bonny Blue Flag.” Our troops were crossing
the river above on pontoons. All was hustle and bustle until
after twelve o’clock at night. The cars were running back and
forth, and locomotives sent forth their screeching whistles, making
this night one long to be remembered.</p>

<p>We knew that something was going to happen, but did not
know what that something was. Some predicted that the rebels
were getting reinforcements, but when we awoke from a short
nap on the morning of the 17th of July, we found everything
quiet and Breckenridge’s and Johnson’s army gone. The gen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>erals
with forty thousand men had crawled out through a little
gap back of town. They had taken all of their guns except
three hundred stands of small arms and one large siege gun.</p>

<p>All of the fortifications, which were made of cotton, were
soon on fire and many fine buildings in the city were burned to
the ground. The soldiers were allowed to roam the town over.
They carried off many valuable articles. I saw a safe in a bank
blown up and several hundreds of dollars in gold and silver
scattered. There was certainly some scratching and running
over each other to get those bright pieces which were thrown
all over the street by the explosion. Many fine pianos and much
furniture was chopped down.</p>

<p>Our cavalry followed the retreating rebs and picked up several
prisoners who had straggled behind, purposely to be caught.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 18th a regiment from each brigade
was sent to tear up the Memphis and New Orleans Railroad.
We tore up the track for ten miles in each direction. We piled
the ties and set them on fire. We put bars of iron on the piles
of ties until they were red hot, and then bent them double so
that the track could not be put down again. We worked hard all
day and at night enjoyed a good rest.</p>

<p>We received marching orders on the 21st and at three o’clock
we moved out in the direction of Vicksburg. We went by the
way of Raymond. We lay here until the morning of the 22nd
when we moved out for Black River Bridge. While on our way
we were in a cloudburst. It came late in the evening and it was
so dark and the rain fell so fast that we could see to travel only
by the flashes of lightning.</p>

<p>At the end of an hour the storm ceased. We were wading
water which was knee deep. Some of the regiments were
sheltered by the heavy timber. Just as we came up to the river
bottom, we were almost blinded by a flash of lightning. I saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
many of the boys go to the ground and two of the 28th Iowa
regiment were killed.</p>

<p>We waded for a distance of three miles before we came to
the bridge. We crossed over and went into camp. We had the
cold, wet, ground for our bed that night.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 23rd, we marched to Vicksburg. The
weather was very warm that day and we were all almost played
out by the time we had marched through the city and two miles
down the river. Here we went into camp.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 25th, we got orders to furlough three
men out of each company home for sixty days. While here we
drew new zouave uniforms. They were sent to us from Indianapolis,
Indiana. There was a hustling time at this place.
Some troops were gathering up captured arms and ammunition.
They were scooping up barrels of lead from the banks of the
forts. The heavy rains had washed the dirt down, and had left
a solid wall of blue lead and pieces of shell.</p>

<p>We found a great many wounded and sick here, but the most
of them were rebel soldiers.</p>

<p>Our Vicksburg army was now being bursted up and transported
to different departments. The 9th corps had gone East,
and on the morning of the 1st of August, 1863 our 2nd brigade
marched on the boats and started down the river to join General
Banks’ army, or the Department of the Gulf. Port Hudson had
fallen two days after the surrender of Vicksburg. The Mississippi
was now open for transportation, and its powerful fortresses
and blockades were wiped out forever. But the cost had
been thousands of our young American heroes’ lives, and also
many many thousand had been maimed for life.</p>

<p>The cost which it took to make this grand American nation
and republic can never be repaid, not even the interest at a low
rate can be paid.</p>

<p>On the 2nd we received two months’ pay, and in the evening
we had grand review. The weather was now getting very
warm. We received orders to march and on the morning of
the 5th, we got on boats and started down the river after our
2nd brigade. We ran down the river about one hundred miles
and landed at Natchez, Mississippi.</p>

<p>We got off of the boats, marched back two miles, and went
into camp. This was a nice country and camp, but water was
the one drawback. We had to haul and carry water from the
river.</p>

<p>We had a great deal of fun at this camp. We were
quartered near a camp of five thousand freedmen who kept up
music, dancing and singing day and night. They were as happy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
as the children of Israel when they were encamped in the wilderness,
after they had been delivered out of bondage by Moses.</p>

<p>A heavy provost guard was kept in town, and many of our
boys without passes were arrested and put in the guard house.
They were soon sending for their captains to get them out as
they were in a regular jail and had to look through iron bars.</p>

<p>We lay here until the morning of the 11th. We then got
on boats and moved off down the river. We landed at Port
Hudson, at six p. m. Our boat had sprung a leak and we got
off and stayed on shore all night, waiting for it to be repaired.
This place bore the marks of a hard siege, some very heavy
charges having been made here.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 12th, we started on down the river.
We landed at Carrollton, Louisiana. On the morning of the
13th we got off of the boats, marched back one and a half miles
and went into camp.</p>

<p>On the 14th, one of the boys in our regiment, while trying
to catch a chicken, was shot and instantly killed by a negro safeguard.
The boys planned to take him out of jail that night and
lynch him, but he was slipped out and I never heard of him afterwards.</p>

<p>We lay here until the morning of the 17th, when we moved
down two miles. We went into camp in the lower edge of Carrollton,
five miles above New Orleans. The next day Colonel
Spicely joined us with the remainder of our brigade, and we all
moved out and went into camp near the bank of the river.</p>

<p>A division of the army of 10,000 men, under General A. J.
Smith, was “lent” to General Banks to assist him in his campaign
against Shreveport and Texas.</p>

<p>On the 22nd Major General N. P. Banks received us into his
army, and we had grand review. On the 29th we were again
reviewed by General Banks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p>September 4th, 1863, General Grant came down to see after
the army and reviewed our corps, the 13th, and the 19th corps.
Late in the evening, he was thrown from his horse. He struck
a curb stone and was seriously injured.</p>

<p>We lay here until September 12th when we got marching
orders for a general campaign under the command of General
Banks. Our army here consisted of the fragments of the 13th
corps, the 18th corps, and the 19th corps.</p>

<p>We got on boats, crossed over to Algiers, and boarded a
train at night. We went to Brasier City which is on the edge
of Berwick Bay, eighty-four miles from New Orleans. This
is as far as the road is completed.</p>

<p>The boys had lots of fun on this trip, shooting at alligators
in the railroad ditches. The water was full of them. We
almost lived on crabs and oysters while we stayed at Brasier
City. The water we had to drink at this place was terrible.
The boys played several tricks at this place.</p>

<p>We went to work here and dug wells. We found plenty of
water but it was so brackish that we could hardly drink the
coffee that was made from the salty stuff.</p>

<p>Our pickets stood over across the bay one mile from our
army. We had left our tents at New Orleans, but we had some
comfortable shelters here. They were covered with the leaves
of the palm trees which grew in abundance here.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 25th, our troops were all drawn up
in two lines facing each other. A soldier that belonged to the
1st Missouri battery was to run the gauntlet. He was drummed
out of service with a dishonorable discharge for stealing from
his comrades. One side of his head and face was shaven. Our
sheepskin band ran after him, playing the “Rogue’s March.”
He looked horrible as he passed, with everyone taunting and
kicking him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>That night our officers from Lieutenant to General got on a
spree. They had some kind of a dance, music and singing of
camp songs. They had a heavy guard to keep the file and rank
from bothering them. At ten o’clock they ran out of commissary
whisky, and sent a detail back to the warehouse to get
some. The guard that was at the warehouse, and our string
guard decided to have a spree also. We procured augers, and
as the floor was on piling, four feet above the ground, we went
to boring through. The first trial was successful and one barrel
was soon issued. Like a bee getting a taste of honey, the
whole camp came rushing to divide if the guard would let them
through.</p>

<p>Several augers were soon working. A German in Company
C was standing on post, when his messmate came running out.
He said, “Chris, let me out!” “I vill, Shon, if you vill divide
up mit me,” answered the guard.</p>

<p>John ran to the commissary and seeing the contents of four
or five barrels spilling out, slapped his kettle under and caught
it full of what he supposed to be whisky. He didn’t take time
to taste it. The boys had struck two kinds of “oil” there. Some
of it was salt beef or “red horse” as the boys would call it. It
so happened that John got his kettle full of the salty brine.</p>

<p>When he stopped, he said, “Hurry oup Chris, or dey vill
catch us.” The guard gulped down two or three swallows,
threw down the kettle, and called out “Corporal of de guard&mdash;Beat
No. 4. Run here queek, I am seek at mine stomach.”</p>

<p>This put an end to the fun of the night. But there were
several drunk men in the regiment after all. Along in the latter
part of the night all of the officers except one had cooled down
and were quiet. That one’s song I will never forget. It was,</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>
<p>The 19th corps crossed the bay. Colonel Spicely had taken
command in the absence of Colonel Barter. On the 27th our
corps was reviewed by General E. O. C. Ord. On the 28th
we crossed the bay and went into camp.</p>

<p>The next morning we went in wagons on a scouting expedition.
While traveling five miles we saw no dry land. This
country was fit for nothing but raising alligators.</p>

<p>October 3rd we took up our line of March through western
Louisiana. We marched up the bayou thirteen miles. This was
on the line laid out for the Opelousas railroad. This is a beautiful
rich country with rice fields and orange groves, sugar cane
and all kinds of tropical fruits. The water in the bayou was
also getting better.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock on the 4th we marched through Centerville,
our company in the rear guard. We went into camp late in the
evening near a bayou in Attakapas Parish. This country is
settled up by the French and Creoles. We found plenty of
large yams here and we had all of them to eat that we wanted.</p>

<p>Our cavalry had a skirmish near this place, capturing a few
prisoners and taking a small gun that threw a four ounce ball.
It was a breech loader and belonged to the 2nd Texas cavalry.
It was drawn by two little mules.</p>

<p>On the 6th, we marched twelve miles and went into camp
near the bayou. This is a nice place, the bayou getting narrower,
but very much deeper. Here General Cameron took
command of our brigade. He was a former colonel of the 34th
Indiana. We lay here until the morning of the 10th. We then
began our march early in the day. We passed though New
Iberia, and after a march of twenty miles, we went into camp on
Vermillion Bayou, near Vermillion. This country is a beautiful
rolling prairie.</p>

<p>While at this camp, General E. O. C. Ord issued an order<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
to arm the citizens, so that they could protect their property from
marauders and thieves. Our boys had no use for such generals.
He was removed from our army shortly after this order was
given.</p>

<p>General Banks had a telegraph line built from New Orleans
to our camp, so that he could keep in communication with his
army, his headquarters being <ins class="corr" id="tn_90" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'at the ctiy'">
at the city</ins> of New Orleans.</p>

<p>On the 11th, we had inspection of quarters. We had four
hours brigade drill each day under the direction of General
Cameron. On the morning of the 15th, we received a dispatch
stating that the 19th corps which was in our advance, had struck
the rebels in force and had had skirmishing with them.</p>

<p>At four o’clock that evening we began marching and passed
the 19th corps at midnight. They were in line on the Carron
Crow Bayou. We crossed the bayou and moved out in the advance.
At daybreak we ran into the rebels. We moved out in
the timber about a mile and supported Nims’ battery. <ins class="corr" id="tn_90a" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'The hebs fell'">
The rebs fell</ins> back and we went into Camp Fairview to cook breakfast
and make some strong coffee. We had marched all night and
were in need of some stimulant.</p>

<p>We scarcely had time to finish our breakfast, when the rebels
made a dash at us. We had a sharp fight, but they were repulsed.
Our cavalry followed them up. On the night of the
18th, firing was kept up at intervals by our batteries and outside
pickets. On the morning of the 19th, Captain Nims’ battery
and the 30th Indiana went to the front on a scout. They
found a strong force five miles out. They exchanged a few
shots with their batteries and returned to camp in the evening.</p>

<p>While here we drew clothing and wool blankets, something
that we had not seen for six months. The nights were now getting
cool and they came in good play. We also had brigade<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
drill that day. On the 20th General Lee came up with a train
of supplies for us, and a force of cavalry.</p>

<p>On the 21st of October we moved out towards Opelousas.
After a march of a few miles we ran against a force of rebels.
We formed our line of battle and after a good shelling from
Nims’ battery, we advanced on them. They fell back without
showing much resistance.</p>

<p>We marched through Opelousas and went into camp at
Bear’s Landing on Bayou Tableaux. Our cavalry had a skirmish
with the 2nd Louisiana, killing five men and capturing several
prisoners. We found better water than we had drunk
since we left New Orleans.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 23rd, we built a pontoon. Our
cavalry and forage train crossed over and went out about eight
miles. They captured eleven prisoners and brought back wagons
loaded with sweet potatoes and other forage, besides driving
back a bunch of beef cattle.</p>

<p>We lay here until the morning of the 29th when we marched
back to Opelousas. Here we met our second brigade commanded
by Colonel Slack. On the morning of the 30th, three
companies of our regiment were sent out on a foraging expedition.
We had traveled about three miles when we met two
cavalrymen coming in as fast as their horses could run. They
stopped long enough to report that the rebels were in front of
us in full force. They thought that their company had been
taken prisoners.</p>

<p>By the time that we had moved ahead through a dashing
shower of rain we came up to the grove where the enemy was
reported to be. We met a company of cavalry, which proved
to be our own men coming out. We went on out about eight
miles, got our forage, and returned to camp without the loss
of a man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>November 1st, 1863, we went back thirteen miles and went
into camp on Carron Crow Bayou. We left General Burbridge’s
brigade at Camp Fairview, as a rear guard. On the 3d they
were attacked by nine thousand rebels. There was a general
engagement. We could see the smoke rising up out of the timber,
and could hear the heavy roar of the cannon and rattling
musketry.</p>

<p>It is hard to describe the fearful thoughts that filled our
minds while we were waiting for the order to go and aid them.
But soon it came, “Move out Twenty-fourth on double quick
time.” We had a run of about four miles before we stopped and
formed our lines within eighty yards of the place where our
retreating army was coming out of the timber. We could not
open fire on account of our boys falling back. Here we were
standing right in front, in danger.</p>

<p>Some negro cooks were shaking white rags from a low
place into which they had crawled for protection. Two companies
of Texas cavalry charged round our flank and went flying
back to our camp. A section of Nims’ battery, which we had
left at camp, and our sick soon sent them back about as fast as
they went.</p>

<p>One of their number had charged through our lines, making
a collision with our cavalrymen. His horse was killed and his
leg was shattered to the hip. This brave man was a rebel, belonging
to the Second Texas cavalry. I was an eye witness to
the amputation of his leg. I never heard whether or not he recovered.</p>

<p>One man in our company was wounded while we stood here.
We got here just in time to save our wagon train and the rest
of Burbridge’s brigade from being captured. They were falling
back rapidly, but were contending with the rebels to the last.
This battle lasted about four hours. The tide had now turned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
and we drove the rebs back three or four miles, and then drew
off. We marched back to camp at night.</p>

<p>On the 4th the dead were buried and the wounded cared for.
Burbridge lost five hundred, killed, wounded and taken prisoners.
The greater part of these belonged to the Sixty-seventh
Indiana. We were all drawn back to Vermillion Bayou, where
we joined the Nineteenth corps, commanded by General Franklin.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 6th we could see a heavy body of the
rebels out on the prairie, near our pickets. We then began building
rifle pits on the bank of the bayou. On the 11th we sent a
brigade across to draw the rebels into a fight. Our men drove
them back to Vermillionville, where they were reinforced. They
followed our troops almost in range of our works. We opened
up on them with two heavy batteries and they fell back. They
were too smart to be drawn into a trap. The loss on both sides
was slight, as this was simply an artillery duel.</p>

<p>On the 15th our entire force drew off and marched back
seventeen miles. We went into camp on the shore of Lake Tias.
This is a beautiful pool of water, three miles wide and nine miles
long, with timber all along the edge. We had a strong rear
guard all day, as the rebels were in sight.</p>

<p>On the 16th we marched to New Iberia, five miles distant,
and went into camp. The Confederate army kept pretty well
up on our track. On the 18th a force of them was in sight of
our picket line. On the 19th our regiment crossed the bayou
and got lumber to build winter quarters.</p>

<p>At four o’clock on the morning of November 29th, 1863,
we got orders to fall in line and march out. After a march of
an hour we heard the rattling of musketry. We charged on
double quick time. Just as we got into the fight the <ins class="corr" id="tn_94a" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'rebels surrundered'">
rebels surrendered</ins>. Our cavalry had surrounded them and had done the
work for them.</p>

<p>We marched eleven officers and one hundred and nine pri<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>vates
into camp as prisoners of war. Our regiment was formed
in hollow square and was given three cheers. The sound traveled
for miles on the still morning air, and then the echo came
back. Thus ended the battle of Lake Tias.</p>

<p>On the 21st our company was sent out on picket guard. The
remainder of the regiment went out with a foraging train. After
they had traveled about ten miles, they met three hundred
mounted rebels, but they seeing that our boys meant business,
pulled off, and gave our boys the right of way.</p>

<p>When they had loaded our wagon train with forage to its
full capacity the boys returned to camp.</p>

<p>On the 22d our cavalry captured fifty prisoners. They were
not organized in the rebel army, but called themselves “The
Boat-burners.” That day was Thanksgiving and all the officers
made speeches.</p>

<p>On the 24th we went out with some foraging trains and had
a regular stampede. December 1st, 1863, we heard heavy cannonading
at a distance. Our cavalry and two batteries were
having an engagement with the rebels. They drove the rebels
back to Vermillion Bayou, but there they met the main rebel
army and our little force had to draw off and skip back.</p>

<p>On the 2d our cavalry went to St. Martinsville. They ran
into a squad of home guards who were armed with shot guns.
Our men drove them back and captured several prisoners. On
the morning of the 4th we rafted lumber across the bayou and
began building our winter quarters.</p>

<p>On the 7th the Nineteenth corps moved off for Brasier City
and left us. On the 18th we drew a new stand of colors which
was presented to the Twenty-fourth Indiana by Governor O. P.
Morton. In the evening we went out foraging. We returned,
both wagons and men loaded down with as much sugar as they
could carry. The boys had just put all of the kettles to use in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
making candy when the order came to cook rations for a hard
day’s march on the morrow.</p>

<p>On the 19th we marched twenty-five miles, en route to New
Orleans. We went into camp on the edge of the bayou. On
the 20th we marched seventeen miles and went into camp at
Centerville. On the 21st we marched through Pattersonville.
After a distance of twenty miles had been traveled, we went into
camp at Berwick, opposite Brasier City.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 22d we crossed the bay, boarded a
train and reached Algiers at six p. m. We got off of the cars
and went into camp. This was one of the worst camp grounds
that we had ever pitched a tent on. It had been raining almost
every day, and the mud was knee deep all over the camp.</p>

<p>A report was circulated that we were going to cross the
gulf, and just at that time a call was made for veteran volunteers.
Two-thirds of our regiment re-enlisted.</p>

<p>Not over six men in each company were left in camp to do
camp duty, as the boys had taken up quarters in New Orleans.</p>

<p>January 1st, 1864, we were sworn into the veteran corps and
“The most of us drank stone blind, while Johnnie filled up the
bowl.” We now had the times of our lives&mdash;those of us who
had been spared.</p>

<p>Right here was a change, as we had placed ourselves under
obligations for three years longer, if needed. We lay here in
the rain and mud, no one knew what for.</p>

<p>On the 8th we drew our veteran bounty and our non-veterans
were transferred to the Eleventh Indiana. When we parted with
them it was like parting with brothers, but soon there was something
to draw our attention from this.</p>

<p>It was a thirty day furlough, at home, where we could see
our loved ones, whose loving arms had not clasped us to their
tender hearts for so many long, weary days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>On the 14th we got on board the steamer “J. C. Swan.” We
crossed over to New Orleans, and had quite a time getting all
of the rest of the boys on board. On the morning of the 15th
we searched the town over and gathered them up. We found
some in the guard house. Several were getting somewhat tough,
and were having a gay time.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 16th all on board, we pulled out for
our homes. We were happy and in good spirits, for we now
thought that we would see our friends once more.</p>

<p>We passed through Baton Rouge, the capital of Louisiana.
This is a nice little city, situated on the east bank of the Mississippi
river. On the 17th we passed through Port Hudson and
landed at Natchez to unload some freight.</p>

<p>On the 18th we passed Vicksburg. It still bore the signs
and marks of the terrible struggle during the siege. On the
20th we passed Lake Providence and Napoleon, and arrived at
Helena just at dark. On the 21st we passed Memphis, and on
the 22d we passed Fort Pillow. On the 23d we ran past Island
No. 10 and Columbus. We reached Cairo, Illinois, at dark.
We had been seven days traveling about one thousand, one hundred
miles, but we had had to tie up part of the time on account
of the fog and high winds.</p>

<p>At twelve o’clock that night we boarded a train on the
Illinois Central. We got to Mattoon, Illinois, at four o’clock on
the evening of the 24th. Here we changed cars and took the
Big Four railroad for Indianapolis, Indiana. We reached that
city on the morning of the 25th.</p>

<p>On the 26th the ladies of Indianapolis gave us a grand
reception and as good a dinner as we had eaten in many a day.
This was served at the Soldiers’ Home. Here we met the Seventeenth
and Forty-fourth Indiana veterans. In the afternoon we
all marched down to the State House, where Governor Morton,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
General Hovey and other officers gave addresses. They gave
the Indiana veterans much praise and honor. Three cheers also
went up for them.</p>

<p>There was a great time that evening, as many of the boys
had friends who had come there to meet them.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 27th our furloughs were all made
out and we disbanded, going in different directions to our homes,
where we would be free for thirty days. It seemed like we were
living in a new world, as all was joy and happiness. There was
rejoicing in many homes, but there was sorrow and mourning
in many more homes, because of loved ones, who lay beneath
the sod on some battle field in Dixie Land. These would never
return to their homes and friends.</p>

<p>I boarded a train on the Indianapolis and Jeffersonville
road. I changed cars at Seymour and ran to Mitchell in Lawrence
county. From there I went on the Monon road to Lancaster.
I reached my home on the 29th of January, 1864.</p>

<p>We spent many happy hours in the company of friends and
loved ones, yet some of our boys met with trouble and were
killed by their enemies at home. These were members of the
order that were called “The Knights of the Golden Circle.” Their
emblem was a butternut pin. They supported the cause of the
Confederacy.</p>

<p>Ambrose Parish, of Company G, was killed by a man named
McCart. Two of the boys who lived west of Paolia were killed.</p>

<p>Our stay at home soon passed away and on the 29th of
February we all met at Vincennes and reported to the captains
of our respective companies. The boys were all pretty wild.
They tore up a printing press and scattered the type all over the
street. The owner skipped for his life. It was reported that
he published a rebel paper, but I think that he learned a lesson.</p>

<p>We got on board a train and went to Evansville. There we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
found a good supper, which had been prepared by the ladies of
the town. It was relished, as we all had good appetites.</p>

<p>On the morning of March 2d, 1864, we drew tents and
marched out of town one and a half miles. We went in camp
on the top of a hill near the coal mine. Almost all of the boys
ran off and went back home. The officers were having a good
time and we thought that we would have a time too. Often
there were not enough in camp for a string guard.</p>

<p>On the 9th of March we drew our guns and equipage and
began getting ready for business. At four p. m. we had dress
parade for the first time in many days. On the 17th we marched
into town and had a grand dress parade. This was a sight for
some of the citizens, and the most of them came out to see us
perform.</p>

<p>On the 23d we had battalion drill, and in the evening we
were called in line by Major Grill. He took us to the brewery
and said, “I am going to treat my mans if dey vill be good mans
and stay in camp mit me.” We all marched past the beer kegs,
cup in hand. Some of the boys, after drinking their beer, fell
back in the rear and marched past the kegs again, getting another
drink, and some got <ins class="corr" id="tn_99" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'several cupfulls'">
several cupfuls</ins> of the liquor.</p>

<p>After several kegs had been emptied the Major noticed that
some had emptied several cups. He roared out. “Stop dat you
mans! You haf done already had enough.” Some of them certainly
had plenty.</p>

<p>After the Major had paid out ten or twelve dollars to treat
the boys, to keep them in camp, about twenty-five of them slipped
out that night and went home.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 25th we were ordered on board the
steamer “Joseph Pierce” and started down the river. We were
hailed at Paducah the next morning. A force of rebels under
General Forest had charged in and set fire to our commissary
stores. The town was a cloud of smoke. They had charged on
our fort, which was manned by a few guards, and the invalids.
They were repulsed and had fallen back out of town, but they
had had enough of it and failed to make the second attack. We
lay here until eight o’clock, then ran on down the river.</p>

<p>At Cairo we met some veteran troops on their way home.
Among them was the Eighth Iowa, or Eagle regiment. They
were all rejoicing because of getting to go home. We ran
down to Columbus. Here they were making preparations and
looking for Forest’s army, but they did not come.</p>

<p>We ran on down to the mouth of White river in Arkansas.
Here a <ins class="corr" id="tn_100" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'squad of gorillas'">
squad of guerrillas</ins> fired into our boat. They killed one
man in Company F. We arrived at New Orleans, April 3d,
1864.</p>

<p>On the 4th we got off of the boat and went into quarters in
the First Louisiana Cotton Press. We were kept in under a
heavy guard and the boys were angry, as they wanted to get out
and run at large over the city.</p>

<p>On the 12th we received a month’s pay. At three p. m. we
got marching orders. We boarded a gulf steamer and went up
the river one hundred twenty miles. We got off at Baton Rouge,
and went into camp on the south side of town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>Here we received news of Banks’ defeat at Sabine Cross
Roads. General Green’s brigade made a charge on our ironclads,
but were repulsed with a heavy loss. While at this camp
two men of our regiment were wounded owing to the carelessness
of a recruit while he was cleaning his gun.</p>

<p>May 2d three regiments and the Fourth Wisconsin cavalry,
with the Black Horse battery, went towards Clinton on a scout.
At night we halted and went into camp. The next morning at
eight o’clock we ran into the enemy, and had a sharp little fight.
We drove them back to Olive Branch Church. Our loss in
this fight was two killed and four wounded. The Major of the
Fourth Wisconsin was killed. We reached camp the 4th. On
the morning of the 8th a salute was fired and the body of the
Major of the Fourth Wisconsin cavalry was escorted to the
boat and sent to his home to be buried.</p>

<p>On the 9th quite a skirmish took place on the picket line. On
the 21st we drew two months’ pay and one installment of our
bounty.</p>

<p>On the 16th of June we were inspected by Major General
Sickles. The weather now was very warm, and our picket duty
and drill kept us busy. We had plenty of watermelons to eat,
and if one had the money, he could buy all of the luxuries of
life. Nothing of importance happened until August 3d, 1864.</p>

<p>At that time a detail of sixteen picked men was sent out five
miles east of camp to guard five hundred acres of cotton that
was being raised by yankees. The government was to get a
part of the cotton. We slipped out after night and about eleven
o’clock came to the negro quarters. Thinking that we were rebels
they skipped in all directions. There were all sorts, sizes and
colors of them. They soon found out their mistake, and came
back and cooked for us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>We moved our line down into the edge of the timber, one
mile from quarters. The third evening two spies passed out
through our line. They were dressed in female attire. Soon
after the last one passed we could see some rebel cavalry about
three miles distant. We drew off and had a run for our lives.
They overtook us at our cavalry post and we had a skirmish.
Two of our men were killed.</p>

<p>On the 4th we lay in line of battle all night. On the morning
of the 7th at four o’clock, we were ordered into line and formed
our line of battle on our picket line. Some of our non-veterans&mdash;who
had come back to our regiment&mdash;raised a racket, as it
was time for them to be discharged, but they had to face the
music. They moved off on a boat in the afternoon, as they were
anxious to get home and did not want to be killed after they had
served out their three years’ faithful time.</p>

<p>The rebel army was threatening us every day, although several
of them were coming in and taking the oath of allegiance.</p>

<p>On the 15th of August, 1864, our regiment was assigned to
the Second brigade of the Third division, in the Nineteenth
corps. On the 16th at eleven a. m., we struck tents and marched
on board the steamer “Starlight.” We landed at Morganza
Bend at seven o’clock. On the morning of the 14th we ran up
the river two miles above the fort.</p>

<p>We got off of the boat and went into camp. We lay here
until the morning of the 21st, when we struck tents and marched
down the river five miles to join our brigade. September 6th,
at two a. m., we were ordered on board the steamer “Chouteau.”
We ran down to Bayou Saira, where one of our boats had been
fired into by a rebel battery.</p>

<p>Our force, which consisted of two white regiments and one
colored regiment, got off of the boats early in the morning, and
marched out through St. Francisville. After a rapid march of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
five miles, we ran into a rebel camp, but the occupants had all
skipped, except four, which we made prisoners of war. We
returned to our boats, and at four o’clock got back to our camp
at Morganza.</p>

<p>On the 12th a salute was fired on account of a victory which
had been gained. It was the surrender of Forts Morgan, Gains
and Powell, the defenses of Mobile. This let us through the
pass. Companies B and K of our regiment were sent on board
the ironclad Ozark on duty. We had almost all of the citizens
in this parish protected by safeguards. The rebels took these
men prisoners, and captured their horses. Our General gave
them to understand that if they were not returned that that
parish would be destroyed by fire. They thought that he meant
it, and they came in with a flag of truce and delivered them up.
But we failed to furnish any more guards to guard rebel property.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 16th we marched out to Bayou Atchafayala.
We were in the Second brigade, which numbered two
thousand, eight hundred. Our commander was Colonel Spicely.</p>

<p>A rebel force of three thousand men and nine heavy guns
were posted on the opposite side of the bayou, behind the levee.
We charged up at two o’clock that night and took possession of
the levee. The rebels all along the line opened fire on us. We
were running against a solid sheet of fire, and the air was full
of cannister, but we got there all the same.</p>

<p>We lay here skirmishing all day. The hot sun came down
on us and we had no water or food, but we could not get back
until night. At night we drew off and marched back to camp.
We had four men wounded. The rebel loss was three killed and
seven wounded.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 19th another expedition was planned.
Some of us were to go out against the rebels at Atchafayala at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
night. Our brigade was chosen to try them again. In addition
we took with us two good batteries. After a rapid march of
fourteen miles we came near the bayou.</p>

<p>At four o’clock in the morning we went to work planting our
batteries and protecting them with redoubts. The two cavalries
kept up a skirmish all day, but we failed to get a reply from the
rebels’ batteries. They had disappeared. Our batteries threw
shells a mile into the timber, and our infantry and cavalry began
crossing over.</p>

<p>That evening we crossed over in yawls, which were hauled
for that purpose. The cavalrymen swam their horses over. We
had no resistance. We could see a small force of rebels hurrying
from behind the levee when we started to cross. These had
been left as guards. The main armies evacuated their works.
They had left four hundred beef cattle, which fell to our possession.
They were guarded by three hundred rebel cavalrymen,
but they skipped out.</p>

<p>We marched up the bayou two and a half miles and captured
three prisoners who had been left out on picket duty. Seeing
that the enemy had all disappeared, we marched back to the
place where we had crossed the bayou. Here we went into
camp.</p>

<p>Soon everyone was busy, preparing himself a good square
meal, as almost all of the boys had a good piece of fresh meat.
There was pork, mutton, chicken, goose, or almost any kind of
meat that one could mention. The odor of the fried meat soon
filled the air, and many hungry boys were working hard to
satisfy their gnawing appetites.</p>

<p>At night several buildings were set on fire, thus causing a
false alarm. Some of the officers thought that we were going
to have a night attack. One of the fires was a large mill. We
fell in line of battle, but soon found out our mistake. We then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
went back to bed, some of the boys swearing because of their
night’s rest being disturbed.</p>

<p>All was well on the morning of the 21st, so we started out
on a foraging expedition. We were soon loaded down with
fowl and all kinds of meat and went back to camp. In the
evening we learned that the rebel force had fallen back about
eighteen miles to Yellow Bayou. We decided to not follow
them any farther.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 22d we crossed the bayou, marched
one mile, and went into camp near where the colored troops
were building fortifications. Late in the evening our cavalry,
which had been out on a scout, returned. They had burned and
destroyed a great deal of property, and had captured three
prisoners. Several negroes were following them. These had
stuck fire to their quarters, and had started for the land of freedom.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 23d we began our march back to the
bend. We arrived at camp at five o’clock in the evening. We
found Companies B and K of our regiment in camp. They had
been relieved from the ironclad.</p>

<p>On the 26th of August our regiment escorted General Lawler
to Baton Rouge. We went on the steamer “Laurel Hill.”
We got to the city at noon. We got off of the boat and marched
up to our old parading ground. We were led by our regimental
band, one of the best in the army. Here we stacked arms to
await further orders. We were acquainted with many of the
citizens, and were treated very well by them. At four o’clock
we got on board the boat and went back to camp.</p>

<p>October the 1st, 1864, three regiments marched out to Atchafayala.
We found a small force of rebels. After a slight engagement,
we drove them off and returned to camp.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 2d a small force, with Colonel Spicely,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
went to St. Francisville. Here they had an engagement with the
rebel general, Scott’s cavalry, and two batteries. They had to fall
back to the gunboats for help. The gunboats shelled them back
until our little force got on the boats and drew off. They then
returned to camp. Our loss was four. The rebel loss was unknown.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 7th, a brigade, with Colonel Spicely in
command, went back to try them again, but Scott was too sharp
for us. He had slipped out and had taken other quarters, unknown
to us.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 9th a detail was called out to guard
a train of wagons. They were going after lumber with which
to build winter quarters. We found the lumber at Echo Office,
on General Scott’s plantation, which is near Point Coupee. We
loaded the wagons and returned to camp.</p>

<p>In the evening a body of rebels came into our camp, bearing
a flag of truce. They had come to turn over some arms and
horses which they had captured from our safeguards. The citizens
were getting tired of having so much of their property
burned down, in retaliation of <ins class="corr" id="tn_106" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'their gorilla warfare'">
their guerrilla warfare</ins>. They also
wanted two rebel officers, who had shot their lieutenant and
then had come to our camp for protection.</p>

<p>Late in the evening our troops who had gone out to Atchafayala,
returned to camp. They had had a sharp fight, losing
fifteen men in killed and wounded. The rebel loss was not
known, as the bayou separated the two armies. On the morning
of the 10th we got on board the steamer “Chouteau”. We
ran fifty miles up the river, near Fort Adams. The rebels were
trying to swim cattle, which they had driven from Texas, across
the river. They were trying to get them to Lee’s army. Our
gunboats had thrown shell into the herd, killing a great many of
the cattle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>On the morning of the 11th we marched off of the boat and
marched out into a swamp. We lay in ambush all day at this
place. After darkness had set in, we marched back on to the
boat. On the morning of the 12th we marched out on track of
the rebels. Their herd of cattle had left a good trail. We went
to Black Pass. Here we captured two wagons and six prisoners.
Two of them were officers. We marched back as far as Swamp
Bayou. On the morning of the 13th we returned to the boat.
We were all tired and hungry, for we were out of rations, and
nothing grew in this swampy place, except alligators and snakes.</p>

<p>At three p. m. we got on the boat and started back down the
river. We landed and at ten o’clock we were in our quarters.
Here we learned that some sharp skirmishing had been going on
since we left camp.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 18th we sent out a force from the
bend consisting of two batteries, two thousand cavalrymen, and
one thousand, six hundred infantry, to Sims’ Port, on the
Atchafayala Bayou. They ran into the rebel force, drove them
back and returned to camp, on the 20th.</p>

<p>On the 22d a wagon train was sent out after wood. It was
guarded by two companies of the Second New York cavalry.
They were surprised by a small force of rebels and captured.
There were also twenty-two negroes, four of whom were killed.
There was a force of our cavalry at the bend. They pursued
the rebels, but did not catch up with them.</p>

<p>On the 23d heavy cannonading was heard from our gunboats
on Red river, and we could see great clouds of smoke. On
the 28th a national salute was fired over news received of a victory
gained in the East by Sheridan’s troops.</p>

<p>In the evening of the 28th a brigade marched out to Atchafayala.
They found no enemy and returned to camp that night.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
On the 31st a large detail and a train of wagons went after lumber
with which to build winter quarters.</p>

<p>On the 1st of November all of our brigade except the Twenty-fourth
Indiana, was sent out on an expedition. They ran
up the river near the mouth of White river. On the 7th our regiment,
the Twenty-fourth Indiana, embarked oh the steamer
“Ohio Belle,” and ran up the river fifteen miles to where the
gunboat “Ozark” was stationed. We got off and marched six
miles out through the country. This is the most broken country
which we were in while in Louisiana.</p>

<p>We found plenty of women on this trip, but no men. Almost
all of the women claimed to be widows. One old Irish
lady gave one of the boys a good cursing. She said that he
was not a genteel Irishman or he would not be caught in the
d&mdash;&mdash; yankee army. She also said that her husband was a
genteel man and was captain of a company in the Second Louisiana
regiment.</p>

<p>Our officers gave orders for the boys to not take off more
geese and chickens than they could carry. While the old lady
was swearing around the boys soon had her geese, turkeys and
chickens divided up between themselves. The fellow that could
run the fastest got the most.</p>

<p>We started back to the boat loaded down with poultry. It
rained on the way back, making our march very disagreeable.
We captured two prisoners on the return to the boat. We
marched at will and were badly scattered. We got to the boat
about sunset. It was a sight to be remembered to look back and
see our straggling boys coming down the long slope to the river,
loaded down with flopping geese and squalling chickens.</p>

<p>We got on the boat and landed at the bend at ten o’clock
that night. On the 23d two hundred rebel cavalrymen made a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
dash on our picket line, half a mile from camp. The colored
troops were stationed at this place. The rebels killed a white
lieutenant and six negroes and left. They also made a dash on
the lower part of our picket line. Here they killed two of our
white soldiers and then made their escape to the rear.</p>

<p>November 27th we had grand review by General Ulman.
Nothing more of importance, except camp duty and drill, occurred
until December 11th, 1864, when the captain of gunboat
number fifty-three of our Mosquito Fleet, while the boat was
near Hog’s Point, went on shore and was <ins class="corr" id="tn_109" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'killed by gorillas'">
killed by guerrillas</ins>.</p>

<p>We were immediately called upon to fit up an army to go on
an expedition, and scour and destroy all of the country for
twenty miles around that vicinity. The troops that were fitted
up were the Twenty-fourth and Sixty-seventh Indiana, three
companies of colored troops and two companies of cavalry, accompanied
by four gunboats. We were under the command of
Colonel W. T. Spicely.</p>

<p>We went twenty-five miles to Hog’s Point, where the cavalry
and colored troops got off and marched down Old river.
We went on down one mile and turned into the mouth of Old
river. We went up twenty miles, near to the place where our
cavalry was scouring the country. We landed and sent large
details on shore to confiscate and burn all of the property in that
vicinity.</p>

<p>At four o’clock our entire force got off and marched six
miles out through the country, in the direction of the Cutoff.
We set fire to all of the buildings and captured several horses,
mules, and cattle. Here we went into camp and foraging parties
were sent out in all directions. This was a very rich country
and was settled mostly by the French. The boats were soon
loaded to the guard with horses, hogs, cattle, sugar, molasses,
and poultry of every description. We were learning them a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
lesson for their <ins class="corr" id="tn_110" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'sneaking gorilla'">
sneaking guerrilla</ins> warfare. Taking the life of
one of our captains had cost them thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 16th a detail was sent to guard the
boats and the remainder of the force marched through by land
to Morganza Bend. After we had marched fifteen miles, at nine
o’clock we got to the camp. At ten the boats got to the bend
and landed.</p>

<p>We almost got into a scrap over the private forage. Colonel
Spicely and the provost marshall had some hard words over the
boys’ chickens, pork, and other private forage which they were
bringing to camp. General, the provost marshall, and his colored
guards, marched down to take possession of our well-supplied
boats. While Spicely and the General were parleying,
the boys were getting their forage off of the boats by the means
of skiffs, and several barrels of molasses were rolled down
through the wheel house. Our boys were getting a little stirred
up over the colored provost guards, and we all expected trouble,
but we were mistaken.</p>

<p>We had regimental inspection on the 18th. On the 19th of
December the Twenty-fourth and Sixty-seventh Indiana were
consolidated and formed a battalion. On the 21st several officers
of the Sixty-seventh were mustered out of service and sent
home.</p>

</div>


<p>December 24th, 1864, we received marching orders. We got
on board a boat and started for Baton Rouge. We arrived there
at two o’clock. On the morning of the 25th we got off of the
boat and went into camp on our old camp ground. We relieved
two regiments from guard duty, whose time had expired,
and they started home at two p. m. We had grand review
that day. That was a dry Christmas for us, but we kept
up a little fun just the same.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 29th we received marching orders,
struck tents, and marched on board the “Laurel Hill.” We
landed at New Orleans on the morning of the 30th and reported
to General Hulbert. We got orders to run up to Carrollton.
Here we disembarked, marched out one mile on the
Shell Road and pitched our camp.</p>

<p>January 5th, 1865, we drew four months’ pay and one installment
of our bounty. On the 11th we were reviewed by
Lieutenant Colonel Smith at two p. m. We received orders and
marched to Kennerville on the 19th. We went into camp and
had such bad rainy weather that we had to wade around camp
in mud that was knee deep.</p>

<p>On the 24th we received marching orders. Every one rejoiced
because we were all tired of that mud hole. At four p. m.
we marched on board the steamship “Corinthian,” which was
bound for Pensacola, Florida. On the morning of the 25th we
ran to the gulf, the distance being one hundred miles. As we
pulled out of the mouth of the river the waves were rolling a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
great deal, and several of our boys got very sick and almost
threw up their socks. After we had sailed an hour, the water
became smooth and we glided along very nicely.</p>

<p>We ran in sight of our gunboat fleet which was anchored at
the mouth of Mobile Bay. At ten p. m. we cast anchor in Pensacola
Bay, near Fort Pickens, Florida.</p>

<p>The morning of the 26th brought to view some grand sights
in that mild tropical climate that were new to us. There stood
two large forts. Fort Pickens and Fort Barancas with their
monstrous guns pointing out through many embrasures. There
also stood the lighthouse towering up two hundred eighty-four
feet above sea level.</p>

<p>We hoisted anchor and ran over to the wharf. We got off
of the vessel, marched out eight miles, and went into camp near
Fort Redoubt, which is below the city of Pensacola, Florida.
This was a beautiful, sandy shore beach covered with a pine
forest.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock the left wing of our battalion came in on
the ship “St. Mary.” On the morning of the 27th the balance
of our brigade, commanded by General Andrews, came in, and
we all moved out one mile and went into camp.</p>

<p>All of the regiments were lined up in camp, making a fine
show of camp life. Each company went to work and ornamented
their quarters with evergreen and white and yellow
sand, writing numbers and names in the white sand with the
yellow sand. This was the most magnificent camp that I ever
saw. There were pictures of animals, birds, and all kinds of
flowers in front of our tents.</p>

<p>We lay here until February 11, 1865, with nothing to do
except to have battalion drill four hours each day. The remainder
of the time we put in by wading out in the bay and carrying
out shoulder loads of oysters. We were having a good time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
then, but we did not know when the storm would come, although
we did know that come it would.</p>

<p>We had protracted meeting and several marched down in
the bay and were baptized.</p>

<p>On the 12th we had grand review by General Granger. We
had no more drill after the 16th. One day a salute of eleven
shots was fired over the arrival of General Asboth.</p>

<p>On the 17th and 18th we had target shooting, and in the
evening Generals Asboth and Andrews came over to see the
Twenty-fourth Indiana perform on dress parade. On the 29th
a brigade came in and we sent our baggage and camp equipage
over to Fort Pickens. This fort mounted two hundred eighty
heavy pivot guns. This is the place where Major Brown held
against General Bragg’s army at the commencement of the war.
I was in the lookout, two hundred eighty feet above the sea level.
One can see for miles over that vast blue water. Two ships
came in with a battery on each vessel.</p>

<p>March 8th we received marching orders, but lay here until
the morning of the 11th. At six o’clock we marched out through
the peninsula, and after traveling twelve miles came to the town
of Pensacola. This had the appearance of a nice city, but fire
had consumed the most of the buildings.</p>

<p>At four o’clock we moved out near Jackson’s old fortifications
and went into camp. This is the place from where General
Jackson marched his troops to New Orleans and whipped General
Packenham, in the year 1812.</p>

<p>On the 15th we had our camp in good shape again, and we
had dress parade in the evening. Fifty rebel cavalrymen made
a dash on our cavalry outpost and drove them back. General
Andrews happened to be out in the advance and they made
him cut dirt to get back to our main lines.</p>

<p>On the fifth we drew five days’ rations and began marching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
at six o’clock. On the morning of the 20th five thousand cavalrymen
came from Barancas. They passed us and took the
advance. We marched in the direction of Pollard on the Mobile
and Atlanta railroad. The country was low and swampy, covered
with a pine forest. We had a time getting our train and
batteries through. Many of them mired down and had to be
pulled out by hand.</p>

<p>After a march of twelve miles, tired and worn out, we went
into camp. That night we could hear the roar of the cannon at
Fort Spanish, near Mobile. A heavy rain poured down all
night, and it was still raining the next morning. We marched
out five miles and went into camp, as all of our wagon trains and
batteries had been left in the rear mired down. Some of them
were almost out of sight in the mud. A heavy detail was sent
back to build corduroy roads and bring them up.</p>

<p>Our pioneer corps was at work in front, constructing a bridge
across a bayou. Several of the boys in different regiments were
killed by falling trees while they were cutting trees with which
to build the roads. In some places the logs laid three tiers deep
to hold our batteries out of the mire.</p>

<p>At two p. m. on the 22d the rain ceased falling, and the
weather became clear. Here two regiments of cavalry and two
brigades of colored troops passed us on their way to the front.</p>

<p>We began marching at ten o’clock on the morning of the
23d. After a distance of twelve miles had been marched, we
went into camp. Here our cavalry had run into a small force of
rebels. They had quite a skirmish, but drove the rebs back.
We lay in camp on the 24th waiting for a bridge to be built so
that we could cross Piney Barren. At six o’clock we crossed
over, moved out two miles and went into camp.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 25th at seven o’clock we began our
march. After a march of two hours we ran into a rebel force<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
of about four thousand, commanded by General Clayton. Our
cavalry and mounted infantry charged them, and after forty
minutes’ hard fighting, the rebel force fell back. They were all
mounted troops. We followed them, and our advance kept up
a continual skirmish until three o’clock. The rebels then formed
in line of battle and made a stand. Our cavalry made a grand
charge. We came up as a support. The rebels, seeing that we
meant business, fell back and were soon on full retreat, across the
Escanby river. They set the bridge on fire and tried to make a
stand, but Nims’ battery made it too hot for them and they
soon fell back. Some in our cavalry were drowned in trying to
cross the river after them.</p>

<p>We captured one hundred, forty-two prisoners. Their loss
in killed and wounded was twenty, ours fifteen. Their general
was wounded in the first charge.</p>

<p>At four thirty p. m. we went into camp on the advance line.
We were all very tired, as we had driven the rebels eighteen
miles that day. On the 25th our brigade crossed the railroad
bridge. We had to march single file and it took some time to
cross, but after two hours had elapsed we were all across and
standing on Alabama soil.</p>

<p>We began marching at eight o’clock, and in a few hours we
came to the little town of Pollard. A few straggling rebels were
in town, but they did not stay to see what we wanted. A great
deal of tobacco was captured at this place, and the depot and
several warehouses were set on fire, making quite an excitement.</p>

<p>The women in this place came out by scores to see the yankee
army. They were surprised, and some of them said, “Youalls
is the best lookin’ set of men that weuns ever seen. Mr. Davis
told weuns that youalls wore little red coats and had horns like
cattle.”</p>

<p>This was the most ignorant set of girls that we had met in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
the southern Confederacy. All of them chewed and smoked
tobacco. Each one <ins class="corr" id="tn_116" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'had a ridicule'">
had a reticule</ins>, filled with tobacco, hanging
on her arm. They were dressed in home-spun dresses and were
barefooted. Our boys had more than a little fun out of them.
Quite a number of grown girls started to follow us off, and our
major had to drive them back. Enlightened America, where was
the ignorance of these good people hedged in at, at this late
date of our civilized government?</p>

<p>After the depot had been burned and a mile of railroad track
torn up and burned we moved out two miles and went into camp.
We were all tired after our march of fourteen miles.</p>

<p>On the 27th a detachment of cavalry, which had gone by the
way of Evergreen Station, came into camp and reported. They
had captured one hundred forty prisoners and two trains loaded
with tobacco. This they burned. We began marching at
twelve o’clock, our regiment detailed as train guard. After a
fourteen mile march in the direction of Mobile we went into
camp.</p>

<p>At one o’clock on the morning of the 28th heavy details were
sent out to build corduroy roads. We were out of rations and
had to move on. We went into camp, nine miles farther on.
The cavalry and colored troops passed us on the way to the
front. The Ninety-seventh Illinois lost one man by a tree falling
on him.</p>

<p>We began marching at six o’clock. Our regiment was building
roads. It began raining, making the roads terrible. We
marched only nine miles and went into camp at six p. m. We
were tired and very hungry, as we were out of rations. On the
morning of the 30th we began marching at seven o’clock. We
reached better roads after a half day’s march. We went into
camp at seven o’clock. One company of cavalry was sent out to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
the Alabama river. They captured twelve prisoners and returned.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 31st, at six o’clock, we marched out
over a very rough, broken country. At half past five we crossed
the Tennsas river and went into camp. We were very tired, as
we had marched almost twenty miles with but little to eat.</p>

<p>April 1st, 1865, we marched at eleven a. m. We traveled
six miles and halted. We tore up the railroad track quite a distance.
We could hear heavy cannonading in front. We completed
our work and marched on. We went into camp at seven
p. m. Our cavalry captured eighty prisoners and a stand of
colors belonging to the Forty-sixth Mississippi. Here we drew
quarter rations.</p>

</div>


<p>On the morning of April 2d, 1865, we heard heavy cannonading
in front. We began marching at eleven o’clock, and when
we had gone six miles we came in range of the enemy’s heavy
batteries and ironclad gunboats, which lay at Tennsas Bay. We
advanced at two p. m., under a heavy rain of shot and shell. We
moved up and formed in line of battle with a loss of one man in
Company E killed.</p>

<p>We now formed our lines around Fort Blakely, one of the
strong defenses of Mobile. Our troops were stationed under a
heavy artillery fire from forts and gunboats, on the lines as follows:
Our colored division was placed on the <ins class="corr" id="tn_118" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'right next (several'">
right (several</ins> of them were going to the rear with bloody heads) next to
the bay; our division commanded by C. C. Andrews, came in
next on the line; and Osterhos, Carr, and Veach were to our left.</p>

<p>We were furnished with shovels and soon went down into
the earth like moles. The laziest man that lives will work under
circumstances like these. The rebel forts mounted some very
large Brooks rifles, which threw thirty-two to one hundred
eighty-four pound shots. They also had three ironclad gunboats.</p>

<p>Our force, which was commanded by General Granger, was
at Fort Spanish, seven miles to our left. There had been fighting
there for several days. We could hear our fleet bombarding at
night. The jar from the heavy guns almost shook the ground.
But we also had plenty here to draw our attention.</p>

<p>April 3d, 1865, we strengthened our earthworks all along<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
the line. Our artillery was not in position yet, but our sharpshooters
kept up a lively racket. A continual roar was still
kept up by our gunboats and heavy guns at Fort Spanish. Colonel
Spicely and three out of our regiment were wounded that day.
This was the first time since we had left Pensacola that we drew
full rations.</p>

<p>On the 4th we heard heavy fighting at Fort Spanish. Our
land forces were making it hot for them and charging was going
on. We could hear them cheering all around their lines.</p>

<p>On the 5th there was sharp fighting all along our lines. Two
men were killed and one wounded in our regiment. We tried
to advance our rifle pits. At night our company moved forward
one hundred yards to establish a new line.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 6th our batteries being in position,
opened on the rebels. They did not reply for some time, but
when they did let loose it was a sight. The air was full of iron
and one could see the dirt and limbs of trees flying in all directions.
There was a solid crash and roar from the big guns on
the rebel forts.</p>

<p>On the 7th, at four a. m., our company took position in the
advance pits. We were advancing our works well. I was one
of the three vedettes who were stationed in the extreme advance,
two hundred yards from the fort and eighty yards from the rebel
sharpshooters. During the day five bullets cut the sod above
the loop hole through which we were shooting, but we escaped
their deadly message. After dark we crawled out and advanced
fifty yards and established other pits. But we discovered just
now that we were running into a nest of torpedoes, and they
were dangerous things to dig around.</p>

<p>We were relieved at nine p. m. At twelve our artillery
opened all along the line, and the rebels soon replied. The two
artilleries had quite a duel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>On the morning of the 8th there was a general engagement
all around the line. Some heavy shells which were thrown by
the rebels’ gunboat fell in the rear of our rifle pits. They went
ten feet into the ground and exploded, throwing up a cloud of
dust and leaving quite a hole in the ground. We had a simple
recruit in our company by the name of Murray. He jumped
out of our pit and stepped up to the edge of the hole.</p>

<p>Captain Taylor called out, “Murray, get down from there!
You will get your fool head blowed off.”</p>

<p>He answered. “Guess not. Captain; they can’t hit that hole
again.”</p>

<p>But several more shots were put in too close to feel comfortable.</p>

<p>Four of our thirty-two pound Parrot guns, manned by the
Twenty-first Indiana, had an hour’s engagement with two rebel
gunboats. One of the boats was disabled and drew off down
the bay. The other one took warning and did not stay long.
Our regiment began digging quarters pits and received marching
orders to go to Fort Spanish, but they were countered. We
then lay in the pits all night and supported the Pioneers.</p>

<p>An assault was made on Fort Spanish at six o’clock in the
evening. A desperate struggle, which lasted four hours, followed.
General Granger’s brave boys then charged over the rebels’
strong fortifications and captured seven hundred prisoners and
one hundred heavy guns. This put a damper on the rebel army
at Blakely.</p>

<p>April 9th, 1865, everything was quiet in the fort. Some
rumors were going that the rebels were evacuating the fort. At
three o’clock all of us fell in line and moved into our advance
rifle pit. The colored troops made a charge on our right, and
the rebels opened concentrated fire on them. They were repulsed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
with heavy slaughter. They fell back to a deep hollow and were
not able to make a second attack.</p>

<p>Our skirmish line was ordered to charge all along our lines
at five o’clock. We had to go two hundred fifty yards, through
three picket fences and over hundreds of torpedoes, to gain their
main forts. I was on the skirmish line, and looking back, I saw
our entire force coming, everyone trying to get across that field
of death and destruction.</p>

<p>At first many brave comrades planted their colors on the
rebel fortifications, to pitch over into the rifle pits, with a bullet
crashing through their heads. Scores were blown out of existence
by torpedoes. The air was full of cannister and minnie
balls, but the work was short and decisive. As soon as the rebels
found out that nothing would stop our determined assault <ins class="corr" id="tn_121" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'they hosited up'">
they hoisted up</ins> white flags all along the line. But it was not before
they were covered with the blood of brave boys who were shot
and had fallen over into the pits on them.</p>

<p>This charge had lasted about fifty minutes. The rebel troops
in front of the colored troops surrendered to our division, for
they knew that the negroes would not show them any quarters,
as they came up with the shout of “Fort Pillow,” and they continued
to shoot at the rebels even after they raised the white
flags.</p>

<p>The loss in our division was four hundred killed and wounded.
The loss in our regiment was fifteen. Captain Merchant of
Company G fell dead on the field. Colonel Spicely’s horse was
blown up by a torpedo.</p>

<p>We captured four thousand prisoners and one hundred heavy
Brooks’ cannon. Three thousand of the rebel troops had made
their escape on trees felled across the swamp to the Sand Battery.
It was about sunset when we got into the fort.</p>

<p>Three rebel ironclads were lying out in the bay, awaiting a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
barge load of marines who had been in the rifle pits. George
Williamson, of our company, wheeled a little brass gun into
position and fired a shell over the marines. It bursted forty
feet too high, but it had the effect all the same. They came back
to shore faster than they had gone out, with white flags fluttering
in the air. The gunboats moved on down the bay towards
the sand batteries.</p>

<p>Our regiment moved down and took charge of the commissaries,
which were well supplied. Two old messmates, Clark and
Tolliver and I saw the upper room lighted up. We went upstairs,
and it proved to be the officers’ dining room. A colonel,
for supper.</p>

<p>The table was the best supplied one that we had seen for
months. There was chicken and other good things too numerous
to mention.</p>

<p>Clark called out, “Hello, rebs! Thanks for your good supper.
We are in need of something of that sort after a hard
day’s work. Get out of here!”</p>

<p>They pleaded for more time but had to be contented to go
with a piece in hand. Two of our soldiers came in and wanted
the honor of capturing some officers. We turned the officers
over to them and took our places at the table. We enjoyed as
good a meal as we had eaten for months.</p>

<p>As I passed out and downstairs, I picked up a caddy of old
Virginia tobacco to divide up with the boys at a dollar a plug.</p>

<p>The Sixteenth corps charged on our left. Their loss was not
as heavy as ours. Several of them were blown up by torpedoes
at night. On the morning of the 10th we marched out to where
our quarters were on the line. We passed over that ragged
battle field, and a rebel major and a squad of prisoners were
raising torpedoes. They were as thick as pumpkins on new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
ground. They exploded several by means of a battery. There
were long rows of them which were fastened together by wires.</p>

<p>Heavy bombarding was going at the sand batteries, which is
about half way between Forts Blakely and Spanish. On the
11th we had general inspection. Heavy clouds of smoke were
seen in the direction of Mobile. Much was going on at that
place. The rebels evacuated the sand batteries and Mobile at
eleven a. m., leaving all of their heavy guns and monitors of
war in our possession.</p>

<p>We received marching orders at five p. m. and marched all
night. After traveling a distance of thirteen miles we reached
the landing below Fort Spanish. All was quiet now, except the
cheering that went on over our great victories. Our recruiting
officers returned and we got the news that Richmond had fallen
into our possession April 2d, 1865, and the Stars and Stripes
now waved over the southern Confederacy.</p>

<p>We lay here until the 14th of April, when we marched back
to Blakely. On our way back we met some prisoners whom we
had taken at Blakely. We went into camp inside the fort at
two o’clock. On the evening of the 15th we had general inspection.
Heavy details were at work, getting up all of the
artillery and small arms which we had captured.</p>

<p>Sunday, the 16th, church was held throughout our entire
army, and many prayers went up to God for his kindness in
saving so many of our lives through the past butchery and hell.</p>

<p>On the 17th a national salute was fired over the success of
our armies in the surrender of Forts Spanish, Blakely, Tracy,
and Huger, which placed Mobile in our possession. We had
also received the news of General Lee’s surrender. He surrendered
to General Grant, April 9th, 1865 (the same time at
which we captured Fort Blakely) at Appomattox Court House,
in Virginia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>On the 19th one of our boys in Company G stepped on a
torpedo, just outside of camp, and was blown up in the air
fifteen feet. One leg was blown off, his ribs mashed in, and one
arm shattered to the shoulder.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 20th we marched on board a boat
and ran six miles down the bay to Mobile. We saw several
torpedoes explode in the bay, throwing the water fifty feet high.
We had several torpedo rakes at work knocking them off. The
“St. Mary” had been blown up at the mouth of the pass which is
known as Grant’s Pass. These monsters of destruction were
planted all over the bay.</p>

<p>Our department was commanded by General E. S. Canby.
The surrender of the defenses around Mobile were the last hard
battles of the great Civil war.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 21st we went up above the city and
anchored in the mouth of the Mobile river. At this place we
first heard the news of the assassination of our beloved president,
Abraham Lincoln. His life was taken by John Wilkes
Booth, at Ford’s theater, on the night of April 14th, 1865. This
sad news put a damper over our army. Our flags were all
dropped to half-mast, and many of the boys shed tears and were
mourning. These same boys had shouted themselves hoarse a
few days before over our great victories, which aided in putting
down the rebellion, for we well knew that peace was near at
hand. The chief cornerstone of our American government had
now been stilled for all time by the hands of a wicked assassin.</p>

<p>Two of our gunboats and thirteen transports, loaded with
troops, had gathered at this place. On the morning of the 22d
we pulled up the river to the mouth of the <ins class="corr" id="tn_124" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Tomgigby river'">
Tombigbee river</ins>, to await the arrival of the remainder of our fleet. Here we found
one of our gunboats, lying on guard duty. During the day sev<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>eral
flat boats loaded with citizens passed us on the way back to
Mobile.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 23d we hoisted anchor and ran on up
the Alabama river to Chocktaw Bluffs, which was sixty miles
away. The rebels had had this place fortified, but had gone,
leaving two heavy guns on the fort.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 24th we started on up the river and
landed at Clayburn, sixty miles distant, at four p. m. We found
some of our cavalry here, who had been left as safeguards.
Three heavy guns had been planted at this place. We landed
and the boys soon brought in plenty of pork and chickens for
supper.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 25th we moved on up the river at six
a. m. After we had gone seventy miles we anchored at nine
o’clock. This is a beautiful country and has very large plantations.
The colored troops got off of the boats here and marched
through by land.</p>

<p>On the 26th we ran along by the side of the “Mustang” and
drew rations, as this was a commissary boat. We passed Mattee’s
landing at nine o’clock and Prairie Bluff at ten. We captured a
flat boat, which was loaded with rebel supplies, and was trying
to get away from our cavalry. Our advance boat was fired into
by a squad <ins class="corr" id="tn_125" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'of gorillas and'">
of guerrillas and</ins> one man was killed. We landed, got
off of the boats and found where their horses had just been fed,
but now they were fleeing for safer quarters. We burned all
of the buildings on several plantations.</p>

<p>We got on the boats and moved on up the river. Many dead
rebel soldiers and horses floated past us during the day. They
had been drowned at the time of Wilson’s raid. We landed at
ten o’clock at night.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 27th we passed Cahawba, where we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
took three of our men from the rebels, who they had made prisoners.
Some of the citizens of this place cheered our brave boys
while they played national airs. We landed at Selma at two
o’clock. We went into camp on the river bank opposite the
town. This is a beautiful little town, situated on the bank of the
Alabama river. The surrounding country is also very beautiful.</p>

<p>The boys went out and soon returned with plenty of good
things to eat. We lay here until the morning of the 28th. We
then broke camp, crossed the river and marched through the
town. We went into camp near the rebel fortifications, which
General Wilson’s cavalry had charged and captured a few days
before. They had blown up the arsenal and burned many stores.
They then continued on their raid, and went in the direction of
Montgomery, the capital of the state. This was called Wilson’s
Raid.</p>

<p>There had been strong fortifications around this arsenal, as
we could see. Many heavy guns and hundreds of pounds of ammunition
had been turned out of this arsenal. Many of the citizens
were now coming in and taking the oath of allegiance to
our government.</p>

<p>April 29th we sent a force out on a scout to look for rebels.
They found several paroled prisoners whom Wilson had captured.
April 30th we were mustered for eight months’ pay. In
the evening a small force of rebels came in bearing a flag of
truce. They were bringing provisions to their sick and wounded
in the hospitals here. We were busy all day cleaning and
straightening up our quarters.</p>

<p>May 3d, 1865, a general order was read at dress parade. It
was as follows: “There will be a cessation of hostilities until
further orders, by order of General E. S. Canby, commander of
the Department of the Gulf, and there will be forty-eight hours’
notice given before going into hostilities again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>On the 5th of May an official report said: “There will be
no more fighting done east of the Mississippi.” That day cheering
and music were kept up throughout our camps.</p>

<p>Dick Taylor had surrendered the last armed force east of the
Mississippi to General E. S. Canby at Demopolis on the <ins class="corr" id="tn_127" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Tombigby river'">
Tombigbee river</ins>. On the morning of the 6th a train of cars came in
from Demopolis. This was the first train that we had seen for a
long time. After this two trains ran each day.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 7th the prisoners who had been captured
at Blakely came into camp and we gave them a good,
square meal. They started on their way home, rejoicing. They
claimed that we treated them better than the old southern
planters, in dividing rations.</p>

<p>General Kirby Smith, with his command, skipped out for
Mexico to join the French army, which was at war with Mexico.
May 8th we had grand review by General C. C. Armstrong, the
commander of our division.</p>

</div>


<p>On the morning of May 11th, 1865, we received marching
orders and at seven a. m. we marched down to the river. We
boarded the “Joab Lawrence” and started down the river. On
the morning of the 12th we met several transports going after
the remainder of our brigade.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 13th we landed at the city of Mobile.
We marched out three miles, near the Mobile and Atlanta railroad.
On the 15th we drew six months’ pay and one installment
of bounty. May 18th we received an official report of the capture
of Jeff Davis.</p>

<p>On the 25th one of the greatest explosions of the war took
place in Mobile. One hundred tons of loose powder and all of
the fixed shell and ammunition that had been turned over to the
government was stored in the warehouses at the wharf. The
colored troops were there on guard duty, but no one was left to
tell how it was set off.</p>

<p>The explosion shook the ground for several miles. The loss
was terrible. One thousand, two hundred people were killed
and wounded. The most of them were colored troops and citizens.
Several large boats, loaded with ammunition, went up
with the explosion, or were set on fire and went down.</p>

<p>The buildings in eight blocks were leveled to the ground,
and windows were jarred out for several blocks back in the city.
The loss was estimated at five million dollars’ damage. Many
of the dead and wounded were covered up in the ruins and
burned. The fire lasted for three days, burning the wreck. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
could not be extinguished on account of the bursting shells. They
made a sound like the raging of a continuous battle. Several
were killed with pieces of the shells while trying to put out the
fire.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 27th we marched into the edge of
town. We went into camp and relieved the Third brigade.
They were mustered out of service and sent home. June 3d we
were reviewed by Chief Justice Chase. On the 4th we marched
on grand parade down to the city park. We went through the
manual of arms and got the praise of making a splendid show-off.
Our battalion was small and well drilled.</p>

<p>Our camp duty was cut down to two hours and dress parade
at six p. m. each day.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 18th, while we were on dress parade,
a thunder storm came up and just as we reached our quarters
lightning struck one of the pine trees in our camp. William
Edwards, of our company, was instantly killed. Some of the
other boys were badly shocked. There were also some
boys in an Iowa regiment who were killed. They were a mile
from where we were in camp.</p>

<p>On the 22d the leader <ins class="corr" id="tn_129" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'of our land'">
of our band</ins>, Alec Owens, returned to
the regiment with a new set of silver instruments which he had
purchased for the sum of seven hundred dollars. Company A
had donated five hundred dollars on them, and we never regretted
our gift. We were well paid with the music of those
sweet-toned instruments.</p>

<p>On the 25th we received marching orders, struck tents, and
moved down to the landing. The boys had some fun out of
the citizens just as we marched out of camp. There was quite
an explosion from a small cannon, which our boys had loaded
and covered with old clothes. A fuse was left burning. Several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
of the citizens had gathered in and were picking out the best of
the goods, when the pile was thrown high in the air. They did
not stop to find out the cause, but it had its effect, and every one
called out, “More torpedoes.”</p>

<p>We got on board the “Alice Vivian.” We ran down near
Fort Gaines and ran alongside of the steamship “Hudson” and
boarded it. We ran out between Forts Morgan and Gaines
into the Gulf. On the evening of the 27th we passed in sight
of the light house at Ship Shoals. On the morning of the 28th
the wind blew a gale and the sea became very rough. Several
of us were thinking about Jonah and the whale.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 29th we came up with our fleet and
anchored near Galveston Bay. The sea continued to be rough
and we could not land on account of the sand bars between the
Gulf and the Bay. On the evening of the 30th, the water being
smooth, three companies of our regiment got on a small schooner
and ran into the bay. We landed at the wharf and got off and
lay here all night. It seemed as though we were in motion all
the time. The remainder of our regiment came in July 1st and
we all marched through the city of Galveston, Texas. We went
into camp on a beautiful sandy beach.</p>

<p>On the 2nd we had inspection of arms and dress parade at
six p. m. On the morning of the 4th we marched through the
city and all of the troops at this place met at the public square,
where a national salute was fired. Speeches were made and
prayers offered for the glory of our nation. We marched to
camp by moonlight, our band playing the solemn tune, “Loved
Ones at Home.”</p>

<p>On the 9th of July, our left wing, the old 67th Indiana, was
mustered out of service and started home. Colonel Spicely, who
had been temporarily commanding our brigade, went with them.
He had well earned his star but he failed to get it. On the night<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
of the 20th the officers all got on a big booze. We escorted
Colonel Spicely and the 67th through town, put them on the
ship, and started them home on the 21st of July, 1865.</p>

<p>Our battalion was now small. Almost half of them were on
permanent guard duty and the remainder were doing patrol duty.
On the 27th we moved our camp a short distance to clean up, as
our family was now small. We were the only troops left to
keep order and patrol the town.</p>

<p>Our battalion was now commanded by Captain Pollard of
Company K. Nothing of importance now happened except
guard mounting guard and dress parade. On the 28th we moved
our quarters up to the east end of town, near the college and
Catholic nunnery. Some of the boys had a good time trysting
with the nuns at the fence. Others of the boys made good money
by digging down fortifications and opening up the streets. We
got all of the water that we used at the nunnery well.</p>

<p>October 1st we received a large amount of mail. There were
many greetings and promises in those letters. We also received
general orders to be mustered out of service, on the 27th of
October, 1865.</p>

<p>November the 1st, our officers were all busy making out our
pay rolls and discharge papers. The 48th Ohio relieved us from
guard duty on the 4th and we turned over all of our camp equipage
on the 14th.</p>

<p>The boys who wished to remain at that place were mustered
out of service and started for New Orleans to get their pay and
settle up with Uncle Sam. They left on the 15th. Several of
them had gotten into trouble with the Golden Circle or Butternut
organization, while at home on their furloughs and they did
not wish to go back to Indiana.</p>

<p>On the 16th of November, 1865, the remainder of our battalion
was mustered out of the U. S. service.</p>

</div>


<p>On the 17th, we marched down to the wharf, embarked on
the Steamship “J. W. Everman,” to start down the home stretch.
We took on six hundred barrels of coal and at one p. m. we ran
out of the bay. While getting on board, one of our boys fell
overboard. A Dutch teamster, by the name of Oose Yager,
pitched a rope to him, and he was lucky enough to get hold of the
end of it and Oose hauled away at it, in the meantime bawling
out, “Hold to the wope! Hold to the wope!” This afterwards
became a by-word. The poor fellow who fell overboard was
saved from the sharks, as many of them were swimming around
the ship.</p>

<p>The water was as smooth as glass and as blue as the sky, not
a riffle was to be seen. Many huge sharks were keeping pace
with the vessel. The sea gulls would light on the masts and flap
their wings and chirp. All of the boys were filled with joy at
the prospect of getting to see the loved ones at home once more.
Some of them were feeling good from turning up their canteens
too often. The sailors laughed and said, “You will change your
tune before going to bed, for the darkest hours of life they say,
come just before the brightest day.”</p>

<p>At six p. m. we saw a small black cloud which looked as if
it were on top of the water. It soon seemed like mountains of
snow were rolling toward us. The waves rolled fifty feet high.
When they struck the vessel, the rudder came unshipped and we
logged along, once more at the mercy of God.</p>

<p>The sailors went up to clear the deck, but some of our drinking
boys, who were on deck drove them down and swore that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
they were running that craft and were going home. One could
hear them yell, “Hold to the wope.” But it was a different
scene down in the hull. Some were trying to pray and others
were too sick to do anything but roll from one side of the vessel
to the other and vomit.</p>

<p>That horrible night will never be forgotten by some of the
boys of the old 24th Indiana. The morning of the 18th came
and found our little wrecked vessel still wallowing in the foamy
billows of that stormy deep. The storm had abated just a little.
We knew not how far we had been carried from our course by
the storm and the compass was out of order. The captain of
the vessel had to do something, so he set the reef sails, got up
steam, and pulled out to find land somewhere.</p>

<p>On the 19th the sea was calmer, but no land was to be seen.
The morning of the 20th found us anchored in sight of Powder
Horn, at the mouth of <ins class="corr" id="tn_133" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Matagordia Bay'">
Matagorda Bay</ins>. This was not many
miles from Indianola, one hundred ten miles from Galveston,
after we had been tossed about by the storm, five or six hundred
miles.</p>

<p>At seven a. m. the steamer “Clinton,” on her way to Indianola,
came in sight. We fired several shots from a cannon and
hoisted a flag of distress. She came back in the evening, took
our ship in tow, and pulled us back to Galveston Bay. On the
morning of the 21st we were cut loose from the “Clinton” and
towed in to the wharf by the tug “Eliza Hancox.”</p>

<p>We felt somewhat calmed down after being tossed about for
five days on one day’s rations. We drew rations and on the
morning of the 22nd, we were towed out into the gulf by the
“Eliza Hancox.” At two p. m. the “Clinton” hitched on and
we started for New Orleans again.</p>

<p>On the 23rd we ran in sight of Sabine Pass. At four o’clock
on the morning of the 24th, we ran into the mouth of the South-west<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
Pass. Here the “Clinton” lashed on to the side of our
boat and we pulled on up the river. A little accident occurred
which drew the attention of many of our boys. Some one in
the regiment was taking a little Mexican dog home. The poor
little fellow fell overboard, and trying to rescue him caused quite
an excitement. A monstrous alligator, sixteen feet long, appeared
on the scene. The dog gave one yelp, made one bite,
and disappeared. Several shots were fired at the alligator but
none took effect. The boys were left to mourn the loss of their
little dog. We had only two pets in the regiment, a bear and a
dog.</p>

<p>We ran past Fort Jackson at ten p. m. On the morning of
the 25th, we landed at Greenville Station, above New Orleans.
We got off of the good ship which had carried us safely across so
many miles of stormy waters.</p>

<p>On the 26th we got on board the “Elnora Carol” and started
up the river. We ran past Morganza Bend and on the 28th we
landed at Vicksburg. On the morning of the 30th, we ran past
Helena and past Memphis some time in the night. We landed
at Cairo, Illinois, December 2, 1865. We had traveled one thousand
six hundred and two miles in ten days, after the time when
we had been reported lost. Many of our friends at home never
expected to meet us again.</p>

<p>We got off of the boat and marched out through the town
to the Soldiers’ Home. Here we were served with a splendid
supper of coffee, beans and bacon, and were given good quarters
to sleep in.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 3rd, we marched to the depot, boarded
the train and ran to Mattoon, Illinois. At ten o’clock, we
changed cars and went on the Big Four to Terre Haute, Indiana.
We arrived at Indianapolis at seven p. m., December 4, 1865.
We got off and marched to the Soldiers’ Home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>On the 5th we signed up the pay rolls. On the 6th of December,
1865, we were payed off in full and disbanded. The
rain poured down all evening. Each comrade hunted for the
nearest road and quickest route that would take him home to
the loved ones that he had not seen for many long weary days.</p>

<p>The 24th Indiana traveled through eleven states and made a
distance of thirteen thousand six hundred and seven miles in
four years, four months and twenty-seven days. The average
was eight and a half miles per day.</p>

<p>There were many of us who never met again, but we will
ever stand in Fraternity, Charity and Loyalty, at Home, Sweet
Home.</p>

<p>Names of states the 24th Indiana traveled through: Indiana,
Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas,
Louisiana, Florida, Alabama and Texas.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
